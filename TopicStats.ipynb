Emergency medical response, building collapse/search and rescue, high angle rescue, hazardous materials incidents, automobile accidents, swift water rescue, wildland fire fighting, infectious disease cases, domestic terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and active shooter incidents are many of the duties performed by firefighters. And yes, they still fight fires — in 2013, more than 1 million fires were reported — with lives saved in the process. Fred McChesney, former big tobacco lobbyist and economist-for-hire turned University of Miami Professor, whose opinion piece, “Fewer fires, so why are there far more firefighters?” was published Thursday, misled readers. We agree that the International Association of Fire Fighters is a powerful union. And we do not apologize for that — and in fact, we advocate that firefighters deserve to earn a good living for the risks they take in the performance of their job on behalf of their communities and country. We also agree that fires across the United States are decreasing. That is occurring for a number of reasons. One big one is the work of firefighters in the community on fire prevention activities, such as fire safety inspections and public education. And while firefighters are performing these duties, the IAFF and its affiliates are working at the federal, state and local levels to strengthen public safety through better building construction codes, promoting the use of non-toxic flame retardants and improving sprinkler and smoke detector laws that are credited with the decrease in fires and fire-related injuries and deaths. Recent studies by the National Institute of Standards and Technology examining response to high-rise and residential structure fires show that the only effective way to limit fire spread and minimize loss of life and property is by ensuring that when there is a fire, the right number of trained firefighters arrive on the scene quickly, with the right equipment. Another study conducted by NIST which examined fire fighter’s response to emergency medical and trauma incidents concluded that larger crew sizes improve patient care and likely increase the safety of patients and firefighters alike. Is McChesney arguing that we should make less of an effort to save lives by cutting firefighters. Because that’s the effect that fewer firefighters would have on the fire scene. And even though there are fewer fires, every single one of those fires that do occur deserve the best response a community can afford because lives are usually at risk. In addition, a powerful study by Arizona State University shows cities that strive to adequately staff their departments with career firefighters are also lessening property loss and fire related injuries and death. In a three month period of 2012, the study shows that response to fires by an adequately staffed Phoenix Fire Department saved an estimated 2,300 jobs and $10.6 million in adjusted state tax revenues. Page 2 of 2 - The professor also misleads his audience by stating that most communities have separate ambulance services, allowing readers to believe that fire departments are just duplicating work. Yet, in an overwhelming majority of communities in the United States, emergency medical care and transport are provided by career fire departments with firefighters who maintain basic and advanced life support certifications. This system works well because fire stations are set up throughout each community to respond quickly. And for an elderly person in cardiac arrest, or a child with head trauma and bleeding in a car accident, having a trained firefighter there to quickly to administer CPR or to pry the child out of the car with the jaws of life, then administer critical medical care is a priority for anyone who cares about the essential government function of saving lives. McChesney also gets it completely wrong that the IAFF objects to “merged” fire and EMS services. In fact, the IAFF has embraced and led the way at the national level for fire-based EMS service because of the efficiencies of the system. While there are some hold-out communities in moving to fire-based EMS systems, those holdouts are usually attributable to failures of command staff by either attempting to “force” a merge, or by failing to appropriately involve the firefighters in their jurisdiction in the decision-making on how best to merge the systems. And McChesney glosses over the fact that the times and needs of communities have changed. The changes have been dramatic and significant, and so have the appropriate training and level of service provided by career fire departments. The need for reliable, efficient and effective all-hazards response can clearly be seen in dramatic events such as 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, Super Storm Sandy, the civil unrest in Ferguson and Baltimore, and natural disasters. Firefighters have effectively evolved into specialized multi-role responders, requiring specialized training to meet the needs of citizens when they are at their most vulnerable. And again, because of the strategic placement of fire stations in communities, firefighters meet those needs effectively across the globe. For elected officials charged with making their community safe, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for providing optimum public safety. It is the job of every community to determine the level of emergency response services it should provide its citizens using the scientific and academic studies on establishing community risk levels that are available today. We can’t predict if some elected leader somewhere will look at McChesney’s ill logic and silly conclusions and decide it’s worth a consideration, but we can say that if elected leaders take a serious approach to risk assessment, they will not reach a conclusion that looks anything like McChesney’s.

It sums up our collective failure to treat other people as our equals, as fellow human beings with dignity and respect. It sums up our failure to show compassion to the most desperate people on earth. Allah will certainly hold every one of us to account. \\n\\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful All praise is due to Allah, we praise Him, seek His aid and His Forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evils of our souls and the evils of our actions. Whomsoever Allah guides there is none to misguide and whomsoever Allah misguides there is none to guide. I bear witness that there is none Worthy of Worship except Allah, alone, without any partners and I bear witness that Muhammad (SAW) is His servant and Messenger.

The worst of affairs are the newly invented matters (in religion), every newly invented matter (in religion) is an innovation, every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire. To Proceed: \\n\\nMy Dear Brothers and Sisters, I am sure many of you would have seen the picture a fortnight ago of a drowned Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi. Newspapers around the world and social media have shown the same picture, of the three-year-old boy, Aylan, who fled with his family from the Syrian civil war, and whose dead body was washed up on a beach in Turkey. \\n\\nWe\\'re getting so used to being shocked and horrified by images in the media, but this picture was something else. This picture tells us so much about what\\'s wrong with the world, and more importantly, it tells what\\'s wrong with us. \\n\\nThis picture sums up the human story, the human tragedy behind the headlines. Millions of lives have been affected by today\\'s man-made disasters, from the Rohingya people in Burma to North-East in Nigeria to Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Eritrea and Syria. Innocent people are being murdered, bombed, burnt out of their homes and driven from their neighbourhoods in some people\\'s mad rush for power. The image of this little boy\\'s body on the beach sums up our human failure to live and let others also live. It sums up our collective failure to treat other people as our equals, as fellow human beings with dignity and respect. It sums up our failure to show compassion to the most desperate people on earth. Allah will certainly hold every one of us to account. \\n\\nMy Dear Brothers and Sisters, We only have a few minutes for Friday Sermons. We don\\'t have time for details, and it\\'s beyond our scope to point fingers of blame, and to consider whys and wherefores. Things aren\\'t that simple. The reasons are complex. This isn\\'t just about the wars of wealthy nations for the resources of poor nations. It\\'s also about our leaders\\' corruption, greed and incompetence. In so many countries, leaders are oppressing their people. But it\\'s not only at the high levels of government. In so many communities and in so many homes, we are unjust towards our husbands and wives, our parents and our children. We often complain about others out there, but many of us are no different. Many of our problems are home made. The Noble Quran has a stern warning for us in Surah Al-Ra\\'d, 13:11, \\n\\n\"Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is within themselves.\" \\n\\nDear Brothers and Sisters, The mess that we see out there is only a visible expression of the mess inside our own lives and inside our own hearts. If we Muslims were anything like our noble Prophets and their companions, the Muslim world would not be in such a wretched state today. We need to cleanse and purify ourselves inwardly first, in our hearts, our desires, our longings and our attachment to this worldly life. Only when we allow ourselves to be guided by the Nur, the light of Allah, and not by our own selfish egos, only then will things get better for us. \\n\\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that there are now over 50 million refugees worldwide. Half of them are children, and the main victims in this real life drama are always the orphans. When their parents are either killed or maimed or in prison, the poor orphans are left without financial and emotional support to sustain them. \\n\\nWhat do our Noble Quran and our Prophetic Sunnah teach us about orphans? There are numerous references in the Quran and the Hadith. We have time only for a few. One of my favourite verses is Ayatul Birr, the verse in Surah Al-Baqara (Verse 177) that describes the truly righteous, virtuous persons: \\n\\n\"It is not righteous (or virtuous) that you simply turn your faces towards East or West; but it is righteous/virtuous to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your wealth, out of love for Him, for your family, for orphans, (repeat: \"for the orphans\") for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the freedom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and to practice regular charity, to fulfill the promises (the contracts), which you have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. These are the people of truth, the muttaqeen, those who are cautiously aware of Allah.\" \\n\\nIf we want Allah\\'s blessings and if we want to draw nearer to Allah, if we want Allah to love us, then we must do what pleases Allah. We must help orphans. We must personally take care of them, or at least pay something towards their care. \\n\\nAs we all know, Prophet Muhammad (SAW) was himself an orphan, whose father died before he was born and whose mother died when he was still very young. \\n\\nSurely Allah\\'s wisdom decreed that our beloved Prophet should be an orphan, so that his example would be a source of comfort and inspiration to million of orphans throughout history. Every orphan should know that our beloved Prophet was just like them, feeling their pain, feeling their loneliness and vulnerability. \\n\\nThe Hadith tells us of the high status given to those who care for the orphan. Imam Al-Bukhari narrated that Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: \\n\\n\"I and the custodian of an orphan are like this (together) in Paradise.\" And he joined his forefinger and middle finger together.\" \\n\\nIbn Majah also narrated on the authority of Abu Hurairah that Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: \\n\\n\"The best Muslim house is a house in which an orphan is well treated; and the worst Muslim house is a house in which an orphan is badly treated.\" \\n\\nThe above Prophetic Hadiths show clearly that if someone takes good care of an orphan, he is sure to enter paradise. \\n\\nIn another authentic Hadith, Abu Hurairah narrated that Prophet Muhammad, (SAW) said: \\n\\n\"He who looks after a widow and a needy person is like a fighter for the cause of Allah.\" He also said: \\n\\n\"Like someone who stands up the night in prayer for worship and someone who is always fasting.\" (Al-Bukhari) \\n\\nDear Brother and Sisters, Wallahi, caring for orphans and helping others to care for them is a guaranteed way to win Allah\\'s good pleasure and enter into paradise. We are facing one of the greatest mass movements of refugees in 70 years since the Second World War. And most of these refugees are Muslims and many are children. It\\'s time we opened up our hearts, and our homes, to take responsibility for some of them. They desperately need help. Many non-Muslims have already responded with compassion and generosity. We should be amongst the foremost to do so. Food and medicines, as well as blankets, tents and winter clothing are being collected in many areas. Some people are freeing up spare rooms to offer to refugees. \\n\\nLet\\'s all do what we can, let\\'s check what\\'s being done in our local areas and let\\'s give this very noble cause the full-hearted support it deserves. \\n\\nMy Respected people, Our noble Prophet praised the widows whose husbands die and who refuse to remarry, so that they can raise their children without risking bad treatment from a stepfather. Allah alone knows the hardship such widows must endure. \\n\\nImagine, my dear sisters and brothers, how precious the orphan is in Allah\\'s eyes. Allah guarantees paradise to the ones who care for orphans. Allah guarantees paradise to the widows who refuse to remarry, fearing that her next husband may not be good to her children. Such women were praised by Prophet Muhammad (SAW). Auf Bin Malik Al-Ashja\\'i narrated that Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: \\n\\n\"I and a woman with dark brown cheeks will be like these (i.e. together) on the Day of Judgement (and he joined his forefinger and middle finger together); this is a widow, although beautiful and noble, who devoted herself to her orphans after her husband\\'s death, until they became strong enough or died,\" \\n\\nThe scholars of Hadith tells us that, \"a woman with dark brown cheeks\" means a widow who refused to re-marry, and she became pale with hard work and sorrow, and her cheeks became dark brown. \\n\\nThese Hadiths clearly tell us how much Allah loves those who care for the orphans. They raise their children with love. They trust in Allah (tawakkul) and cultivate healthy Iman (faith) in their children\\'s hearts. \\n\\nDear Sisters and Brothers, You and I could be like this (show index/middle finger together), side by side with our beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in Al-Jannah Firdaws, if we take care of the orphans, near and far. \\n\\nOn the other hand, those who neglect orphans or who treat them harshly, can risk incurring Allah\\'s displeasure. We read in Surah Al-Maa\\'uun: \\n\\n\"Have you seen the one who denies the judgment day? That is the one who drives away the orphans.\" \\n\\nMy dear Sisters and Brothers, Let us not, by our carelessness and lack of compassion, fall into this category. Never neglect the suffering of orphans. Thousands, no, millions of orphans are waiting out there, to be loved, to be cared for, to be fed, clothed and educated. They could be your own children! They could be yours or my grandchildren! But for the grace and mercy of Allah, that could happen to anyone! We have no guarantees that we will always have comfort, security and wealth! We cannot and we should not be indifferent to the plight of orphans anywhere in the world. Let\\'s do what we can to help! \\n\\nIn Nigeria alone, over two million Nigerians have been displaced. Sixty thousand children are being born in displaced persons camps this year alone. They are desperately in need of our help. God bless you as you assist them. \\n\\nLet us send a loud and clear message to orphans everywhere, that they are not alone. Let them know that we do care. We ask Allah to bless our efforts and to infuse it with His barakah, so that the benefits of our work can be magnified many times over. Ameen! \\n\\nWe appreciate the efforts of some individuals, NGOs, Government agencies and many organisations in their struggles to assist the orphans, widows, refugees, disabled persons, and migrants. Like NEMA, JNI, NSCIA, SCSN, JIBWIS under the able leadership of Sheikh Abdullahi Bala Lau, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar the Turaki of Adamawa and many individuals, Muslims and Christian organisations that time will not allow me to mention. May God pay them back and reward them abundantly. \\n\\nMy Respected Brothers and Sisters, It is our negligence that makes the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to make a mockery on us and publish a cartoon about the death of the drowned Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi on the cover of its latest issue. The magazine used two cartoons both including drawings of Aylan\\'s death. In one of the drawings it says: \"Proof that Europe is Christian.

Those 35.8 million homes represent 43 percent of the 83.4 million single family homes and condos in all counties analyzed for the report. \\n\\nFor the report RealtyTrac assigned a natural disaster risk score to 2,318 counties nationwide with sufficient home value data available. Based on its score, each county was assigned to one of five risk categories for overall risk of natural disaster: Very High, High, Moderate, Low and Very Low. Similar scoring and ranking was also used to rate risk for each of the five natural disasters individually (see full methodology below). \\n   \\n\"In the interest of personal safety and protecting the value of what is likely their biggest financial asset, prospective buyers and investors should be aware of any natural disaster risk impacting a potential home purchase,\" said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. \"There is no reason homebuyers need to be surprised with natural disaster risk information when wading through a stack of disclosures at the closing table given the widespread availability of this data online and even through mobile apps. \\n\\n\"In most cases learning about natural disaster risk will not stop a home sale, but it will help buyers make a better-informed decision about where to buy and also be prepared in terms of appropriate insurance coverage and family contingency plans depending on the type of natural disaster risks most affecting the home they end up purchasing,\" Blomquist added. \\n\\nStates with the most homes in High risk or Very High risk counties for overall natural disaster risk are California (8.4 million), Florida (6.7 million), New York (2.4 million), New Jersey (2.3 million) and North Carolina (2.3 million). \\n\\nMetro areas with the most homes in High risk or Very High risk counties for overall natural disaster risk are New York (3.5 million), Los Angeles (2.5 million), Miami (1.9 million), Houston (1.2 million), and Riverside-San Bernardino in Southern California (1.1 million). \\n\\n\"The weather is beautiful in SoCal, but we are statistically more susceptible to the risk of fire, floods and earthquakes than most areas. Our agents must be articulate in explaining the higher risks to buyers. People have to be able trust their agent to fully disclose the risks of natural disasters and homeownership to allow buyers to make the most informed decisions,\" said Mark Hughes, chief operating officer with First Team Real Estate , covering the Southern California market. \"A well-informed knowledgeable buyer is best prepared to take on the potential risks associated with SoCal homeownership.\" \\n\\n29 Percent of Homes Worth an Estimated $4.7 Trillion in Counties with High Hurricane Risk \\nThe report found that 24.5 million single family homes and condos (29 percent of the 83.4 million total) with a combined estimated market value of $4.7 trillion are in counties with a High risk or Very High risk for hurricanes. \\n\\nStates with the most homes in High risk or Very High risk counties for hurricanes are Florida (6.7 million), North Carolina (2.4 million), Virginia (2.0 million), New York (1.9 million) and New Jersey (1.8 million). \\n\\nMetro areas with the most homes in High risk or Very high risk counties for hurricanes are New York (3.0 million), Miami (1.9 million), Washington, D.C. (1.8 million), Boston (1.1 million) and Tampa (953,000). \\n\\n\"The allure of South Florida\\'s sun and surf, for most, outweigh any concern of a hurricane threat,\" said Mike Pappas, CEO and president of the Keyes Company covering the South Florida market. \"The improved communication, continual education and enhanced predictability all give comfort to our coastal residents. History has shown that we are not only able to survive but in fact thrive with insurance and property improvements after a storm hits.\" \\n\\n13 Percent of Homes Worth an Estimated $1.8 Trillion in Counties with High Wildfire Risk \\nThe report found that 10.6 million single family homes and condos (13 percent of the 83.4 million total) with a combined estimated market value of $1.8 trillion are in counties with a High Risk or Very High risk for wildfires. \\n\\nStates with the most homes in High risk or Very High risk counties for wildfires are California (1.9 million), New York (1.6 million), Florida (1.6 million), North Carolina (1.1 million), and New Jersey (1.1 million). \\n\\nMetro areas with the most homes in High risk or Very High risk counties for wildfires are New York (2.1 million), Riverside-San Bernardino in Southern California (1.1 million), Charlotte, North Carolina (471,905), Columbia, South Carolina (252,155), and Charleston, South Carolina (214,666). \\n\\nHome Values Higher in High Risk Areas, 10-Year Price Growth Stronger in Low Risk Areas \\nHomes in Very High risk counties for overall natural disaster risk had an average estimated market value of $170,237, and homes in High risk counties had an average estimated market value of $191,244. Meanwhile the average home value in Very Low risk counties was $151,793, and the average home value in Low risk counties was $154,464. \\n\\nAlthough average home values were higher in higher-risk counties, home price appreciation over the past 10 years was stronger in lower-risk counties. Among 551 counties with sufficient historical home price data, home sales prices in counties with a Low risk for natural disasters increased 6.6 percent on average between 2005 and 2015, and home sales prices in counties with a Very Low risk for natural disasters rose 9.5 percent on average during the same time period. \\n\\nConversely, home sales prices in counties with a High risk for natural disasters decreased 2.5 percent on average over the past 10 years while home sales prices in counties with a Very High risk for natural disasters decreased 6.4 percent on average. \\n\\n\"Each year we experience damaging storms and it is with anticipation we recommend buyers make sure they have adequate insurance to protect them from carrying the burden of replacing a roof when the storms hit,\" said Heidi Greer, owner/broker at RE/MAX Alliance , covering the Denver market in Colorado, which was one of six states with no counties rated High or Very High for overall natural disaster risk despite having some counties rated as High risk for wildfires and floods. \"Our mountain areas have a much higher risk of fire and there are regulations buyers must be made aware of when they purchase wooded properties or have the intent of adding structures in wooded locations. Buyers who prefer the mountain areas are normally aware of the added risk before they consider moving there.\" \\n\\nHome price appreciation over the past three years has been stronger in higher risk counties for natural disaster. In counties with a High risk for overall natural disaster, home prices increased 16.6 percent between 2012 and 2015 on average, while home prices in counties with a Very High risk for natural disasters increased 20.4 percent during the same time period. Home prices in Low risk counties increased an average of 10.1 percent over the past three years, and home prices in Very Low risk counties increased an average of 12.8 percent during the same time period. \\n\\n\"Across Ohio, amenities abound to assist in the mitigation of potential risk of natural hazards,\" said Michael Mahon, president at HER Realtors , covering the Cincinnati, Dayton and Columbus markets in Ohio, where just one county was rated High for overall natural disaster risk despite the state having the seventh highest number of homes in counties rated High risk for tornados. \"Given the risk of tornadoes some homebuyers are only interested in seeing homes with basements to mitigate the risk.\" \\n\\nReport methodology \\nIn its second annual U.S. Natural Disaster Housing Risk Report, RealtyTrac analyzed five different natural disasters posing a risk to housing: earthquake risk, hurricane risk, tornado risk, flood risk and wildfire risk. Based on these five factors, each of the counties analyzed was assigned a combined natural disaster risk score from 0 to 300, with 300 representing the most risk (190 was the highest score among all the counties). Based on these scores, counties were assigned one of five different categories of risk of natural disaster: Very High Risk (Score of 90 or higher); High Risk (55 to 89 score); Moderate Risk (30 to 54 score); Low (15 to 29 score); and Very Low (0 to 14 score). \\n\\nDetailed methodology for each individual natural disaster risk \\nThe earthquake risk score is based on a predictive earthquake risk model created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that calculates the probability of a 5.0 magnitude earthquake occurring within a 30-mile radius over the next 50 years. \\n\\nThe hurricane risk score is based on historical hurricane activity data from 2001 to 2013 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that ranks hurricane risk in each county on a scale from 0 to 456,668. \\n\\nThe tornado risk score is also derived from NOAA data from 2001 to 2013 that provides a Destruction Potential Index (DPI) for each county based on the number of tornados, path area of tornados in square miles and intensity of tornados using the Fujita scale of F0 to F5. \\n\\nThe flood risk score is based on flood zones defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. For this report, RealtyTrac analyzed the percentage of single family homes in each county that are in flood zones considered high risk by FEMA (A, A99, AE, AH, AO, V, and VE). \\n\\nThe wildfire risk is based on categories of Wildfire Disaster Potential (WHP) developed by the USDA Forest Service and Fire Modeling Institute. For this report, RealtyTrac analyzed the percentage of property parcels that are in areas defined as having \"Very High\" or \"High\" WHP. \\n\\nThe 551 counties analyzed for 10-year and three-year home price appreciation only included counties with at least 10,000 single family homes and condos and excluded counties where historic home price data was insufficient. \\n\\nAbout RealtyTrac \\nRealtyTrac is a leading provider of comprehensive U.S. housing and property data, including nationwide parcel-level records for more than 130 million U.S. properties.

The increasingly unpredictable nature of weather patterns, along with threats to our infrastructure provide a warning that major headaches can occur if homeowners postpone taking the steps necessary for proper preparedness. \\n  \\n“Proper preparedness is the best way to avoid potential harm to your home and your family,” said home improvement expert and Generac partner Danny Lipford, “Since September is National Preparedness Month, it’s an especially good time to create a disaster preparedness kit. I like to store mine in a laundry basket, so all of my items are organized in one place.” \\n \\nA disaster preparedness kit should contain the following items: \\n \\n• Fresh water and nonperishable food items—enough to last for about three days. \\n \\n• NOAA weather radio to stay on top of the storm, as well as any announcements from local authorities. \\n \\n• Flashlights and fresh batteries. \\n \\n• First-aid kit and any medications that you may need to last you for several days. \\n \\n• Emergency contact numbers such as police, fire, friends or family, so you can reach out to them in an emergency and let them know you are all right. \\n \\n• Any important documentation and identification that you don’t want lost. \\n \\n• Cash in case banks are not open or are not accessible. \\n \\nIt’s also important for homeowners to purchase a source of backup power, which can save Americans from scary situations that result from power loss. Being properly prepared for weather disasters and power outages can also save money. An outage can cost a homeowner thousands of dollars in lost food, travel expenses and even property damage—all of which can be avoided by investing now in preparedness items. Generac Power Systems offers a broad range of backup power solutions, from portable generators to automatic home backup power systems to commercial and industrial generators that, in the long term, could save millions and provide peace of mind. \\n \\n“Preparing for emergency situations only works if done in advance,” Lipford said. “Take time this month to really think about the potential dangers your family could face and get a kit and action plan prepared. Purchasing a source of backup power now, before disaster strikes, means your home and family will be protected during severe storms and extended power outages. National Preparedness Month reminds us the time to prepare is now, not during or after the threat when it’s too late.” \\n \\nFor more information on Generac and its product line, visit www.generac.com .

But what grows increasingly unsettling for Finger Lakes residents is how often they’re happening in such places as Honeoye, Penn Yan, Ionia, Farmington, Phelps and Palmyra. \\nTo cope with the deluge of natural and manmade emergencies, local, state and federal agencies have ramped up efforts to equip and educate the public, starting with National Preparedness Month in September and Fire Prevention Week in October. Sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, this year’s National Preparedness Month theme is “Don’t Wait. Communicate. Make Your Emergency Plan Today.” All September, residents are being urged to create an emergency plan that they can activate in the event of a natural or manmade disaster. They’re further encouraged to prepare a portable, emergency supply kit containing enough food, water, medications and other consumables to last seven to 10 days, and to create a family emergency communications plan that includes up-to-date contact information for individuals that might need to be reached during a disaster. “When disaster strikes, we want all New Yorkers to be prepared and ready to respond,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a news release earlier this month. “By planning ahead and taking a few simple safety steps, we can all be ready for unpredictable weather conditions and emergencies.” In addition, each week of National Preparedness Month promotes a different hazard-focused theme: the first focused on flood readiness, the second on wildfire readiness, the third on hurricane preparedness, and the fourth on power outage preparedness. More than 21 million in the U.S. have already signed up to take action in their own homes on Sept. 30 — National PrepareAthon! Day. In Ontario County, Emergency Management Director Jeff Harloff said some simple preparation will help residents better handle emergencies. Just having a list of medications and the addresses and phone numbers of family members on hand can be invaluable if you have to be relocated to a shelter on short notice, he said. “Not only plan for you and your immediate family members, but also for your pets,” Harloff said. “It’s one thing we learned from Hurricane Katrina. If you look at the national coverage of wildfires out west — they’ve had very little notice to evacuate. They’re literally grabbing things as they head out.” Farmers in Ontario County especially have done a lot of planning since the last ice storm, he said. “Now they have better networks, they have another location to move livestock to, they have a food network, they’ve looked at alternative power,” he said. Page 2 of 6 - \\nThe first 24 hours \\nShortsville Fire Chief Jason Wagner has a “go bag” packed for each person in his family. They’re stored in his basement. In each are food, water, hygiene supplies, medication, medical items and other supplies. “Are you ready to live for 48 to 72 hours without power or water?” asked Wagner. “What are you going to eat? How will you cook it? Do you have the medications you’ll need? What do your children or older adults need? If you have to bug out, you’ll probably grab your phone, but will you remember a charger?” The website www.ready.gov provides strategies and checklists for families to make their emergency plan and assemble 48-hour survival kits. “People need to remember that disaster can happen here. There’s risk,” he said, adding that people need to remind themselves to check the “go bags” once a quarter and swap out the water and consumables. Under the leadership of Ontario County EMS Coordinator Debra Trickey, the county offers periodic Community Emergency Response Team training that equips individuals and families to know what to do in the first 24 hours of an emergency, before emergency services are available. “What has affected the county, state, and nation — winter storms, flooding — these are things that affect us on a regular basis,” Trickey said. “We do fire safety, fire extinguisher training, how to shut off your gas, first aid training, different types of carries using what they have available, light search and rescue, how to safely search a structure, and triage, which is sorting victims in order of the severity of their injury.” \\nGuest instructors also talk about terrorism and how it affects the state and the Finger Lakes — what’s happening locally and beyond, she said. \\n“We also touch on disaster psychology, which is learning how to deal with what you’re seeing,” Trickey said. “It’s very much a hands-on class. People walk away with a lot of knowledge, which hopefully they can apply.” The next CERT training will take place Sept. 30 through Nov. 18, on seven or eight Wednesday nights from 7 to 10 p.m. The free classes are for people 18 and older, and are designed to teach people what to do for themselves and for neighbors in the first 24 hours of an earthquake, flood or other emergency. Classes typically attract a number of Ham (amateur) radio operators, county employees, church members and people who simply want to help out in an emergency, Trickey said. CERT training, which began in 2008, is held one or two times each year and is a federal initiative administered by the county, she said. Page 3 of 6 - State education, alerts To help New Yorkers prepare for an emergency, the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, in partnership with the New York National Guard, offers periodic Citizen Preparedness Corps training courses throughout the state. So far, more than 64,000 New Yorkers have completed a preparedness training course — more than at any other time in the state’s history. “New York has had 70 federally declared disasters since 1954,” said DHSES Commissioner John Melville. “This number represents two times the national average of disasters, so it reminds all of us of the need to be prepared in the event of an emergency. Developing an emergency plan, and preparing an emergency supply kit, can help individuals become better prepared.” To find and register for a training course, or to volunteer, visit http://www.prepare.ny.gov/training-events . More training classes are added frequently. The state also maintains the NY-Alert website at http://www.nyalert.gov to help keep New Yorkers informed of a variety of hazards. This alert and notification system contains critical emergency-related information, including instructions and recommended protective actions developed in real time by emergency service personnel. NY-Alert sends individuals free messages on severe weather warnings, significant highway closures, hazardous materials spills and many other emergency conditions. It also provides response actions being taken by local and state agencies, and protective actions that individuals should take to protect themselves, their family and property. To subscribe, visit http://www.nyalert.gov , or subscribe to the state’s new mobile app, iAlertz, for the latest alerts and notifications.

When it comes to reducing the risk of fire in one’s home or business, key factors are having properly inspected heating systems and chimneys, working fire extinguishers, and well-functioning smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Shortsville Fire Chief Jason Wagner knows that the number of chimney fires is going to bump up as the weather gets colder. “If you burn wood in a fireplace or insert, you need to have that device inspected and cleaned by a professional,” Wagner said. “You haven’t operated it in several months, you don’t know where the squirrels have built their nests. It’s a gamble.” Page 4 of 6 - Canandaigua Fire Chief Mark Marentette agreed. The time to get chimneys cleaned is now, not at the last minute when everybody else is trying to get it done, he said. Only burn clean, dry firewood in a wood-burning stove or fireplace to slow creosote buildup, advised Victor Fire Marshal Robert Graham. Likewise with all heating systems: Have them professionally cleaned and maintained. Check all flue pipes for cracks, holes or rust and replace any damaged or leaking pipes, Graham said. Proper maintenance is the key to any heating system. The more efficient the appliance is operating, the less likely it is to cause a fire. Have heat tape to keep pipes from freezing? Inspect it carefully and replace any worn or frayed cords. Remove leaf debris from gutters and around tape, Graham said. And conduct a fire drill at home, he said. Children learn about Exit Drills In The Home (EDITH) during Fire Safety Week in school, so parents, grandparents and caregivers should discuss and practice escape plans with family members. Daylight Saving Time ends on Nov. 1. It’s the perfect reminder to change the batteries in carbon monoxide and smoke detectors, Wagner said. If devices are more than 10 years old or not functioning properly, replace them, he said. Unfortunately, many people don’t. “A $2 battery is a lot cheaper than a structure fire,” Wagner said. Sometimes residents also will take the batteries out of detectors after they’ve burned food on the stove or the fireplace pushes a little smoke into the room, and then they forget to replace the batteries. Then when there’s a real fire, the alarm fails to sound. This year’s Fire Prevention Week, Oct. 4-10, will spotlight the theme “Hear the beep where you sleep: every bedroom needs a working smoke alarm.” An online questionnaire distributed by the National Fire Protection Association showed that less than half (42 percent) of approximately 36,000 respondents knew that a smoke alarm should be installed in each bedroom of the home, outside each sleeping area and on every level of the home. “What a very inexpensive investment,” said Ontario County Emergency Management Director Jeff Harloff. “I can’t tell you the number of times that people tell me their first indication was when their smoke detector went off. It’s one piece of equipment that works. It’s inexpensive, and worth its weight in gold.” Another essential safety device is the fire extinguisher. Keep one in the kitchen and garage, and in rooms where there are wood stoves or fireplaces. Make sure they’re properly charged, and learn how to use them. Page 5 of 6 - “So many people have never pulled the pin and used a fire extinguisher,” said Trickey, who goes so far as to have adult students practice to familiarize themselves with the devices. In Canandaigua, Marentette took a look at two dozen of the most recent fires Canandaigua firefighters responded to. The results were compelling. “When people use a fire extinguisher and use it right, it makes a tremendous difference,” said Marentette. “In the 12 most recent fires we responded to where a fire extinguisher was used (before firefighters arrived) we were on the scene for less than an hour and a half. In the 12 most recent fires where a fire extinguisher was not used, the average time we were there was just shy of five hours. The only difference was fire extinguisher use. Our response time was the same.” It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that the length of time firefighters are on the scene of a fire is directly related to the extent of damage the home or business owner will experience. The longer firefighters are on site, the more extensive and far-reaching the fire, smoke and water damage will be. “And make sure somebody’s calling the Fire Department,” added Marentette. “If they’re by themselves, get the fire extinguisher started first, but make sure that the 911 center gets called promptly. Don’t spend a great deal of time trying to get the fire out. If there are two people, one gets people out of the house and calls 911, and the other fights the fire.” Marentette told of one business owner recently who literally had the fire extinguisher in one hand and the cell phone in the other, “and that made all the difference,” he said. As for storage, Marentette recommends that fire extinguishers be kept close to an exit. “When you have a fire extinguisher in your hand, we want the layout behind you clear so you can get out quickly if needed,” he said. \\nWagner said so many of the emergencies his department responds to are actually preventable, if only people would take time to ready their homes and automobiles for winter. \\n“People have to get their winter mind-set,” he said. “This year is supposed to be just as bad or worse than last year. We have to be ready.” Residents should also be reminded that it is illegal to burn leaves anywhere in New York, although tree limbs less than 6 inches in diameter and 8 feet in length, with attached leaves, may be burned from May 15 through March 15, in towns with a total population of less than 20,000. Page 6 of 6 - \\nBefore — and after — the storm \\nHaving prepared for and survived a natural disaster or emergency situation is a victory, to be sure. But significant challenges still lie ahead. After first responders pull away, that’s when the rebuilding process begins. Jim Wolfe of the J. James Wolfe Agency in Canandaigua urged residents to make sure their homes are insured for what it would cost to rebuild, which is more than its market value. If your house is insured for less than 80 percent of the cost to rebuild, he said, you can expect to pay significant out-of-pocket expenses in the case of a disaster. The same goes for the contents of the home — insure for the replacement value, he said. “Document all your contents — it’s huge,” Wolfe said. “Take photographs of the interior of your home, antiques and fine art. Take close-up pictures that show detail, and then store the photos outside the house somewhere, like in a safe deposit box.” Harloff said he hopes the September and October initiatives will inspire people to become better prepared to face any emergency. “The best attention we get is right after an event, whether it’s flooding or a tornado,” he said. “Immediately after that we’ve got the attention of the public, and preparation happens then because it’s fresh in their minds. The farther away you get, the less important it becomes.” Above all, residents should not be discouraged because they can’t check everything off the preparedness list right away, he said. “Any effort is better than no effort,” Harloff said. “Your preparation efforts will be different than your neighbor’s or co-worker’s.

Teichert, 1945 \\n \\nSolomon’s Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 B.C. on the date in the Jewish calendar 9th of Av, or Tisha B’Av. The Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. on the same date, Tisha B’Av. Rome’s destruction of the Temple began in 66 A.D., when Roman Emperor Nero appointed General Vespasian to put down a revolt in Judea. \\n    \\nAlmost immediately, Rome experienced chaos. Nero committed suicide in 68 A.D. His successor, Galba, was assassinated within eight months. His successor, Otho, committed suicide within two months. His successor, Vitellius, was executed within eight months. \\n \\nVespasian was made the next emperor, and his son, Titus, continued the conquest of Judea. Titus surrounded Jerusalem and starved inhabitants for months. He ordered Jewish deserters from Jerusalem to be crucified around the walls. \\n \\nBy the end of July, 70 A.D., the Roman army broke through the walls. Jerusalem was completely conquered by Sept. 8, 70 A.D. Historian Josephus recorded that over a million Jews were killed in the siege. \\n \\nAccording to historian Eusebius, Romans hunted down and killed all descendants of the royal line of David. Jewish Temple treasures were carried off to Rome, as shown on the Arch of Titus, and were used to finance the building of Rome’s Colosseum. \\n \\nThe Colosseum was so named as it was next to Nero’s 100 foot high bronze colossus statue depicting the Roman sun god Apollo, modeled after the 100 foot high bronze colossus statue of Rhodes depicting the Greek sun god Helios. The Statue of Liberty – the new colossus – was modeled after it. \\n \\nIn 79 A.D., Emperor Vespasian caught a slight illness which developed into severe diarrhea. As he died, his last words were: “Oh dear! I think I’m becoming a god!” \\n \\nTitus became the next emperor and two months later Mount Vesuvius erupted, destroying the Bay of Naples, including the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Thousands of Roman citizens were buried alive under feet of volcanic ash. \\n \\nIn the spring of 80 A.D., Rome caught on fire and burned out of control for three days and nights. This was followed by the worst outbreak of the plague Rome had ever endured. \\n \\nTitus then decided to dedicate the Colosseum with inaugural games to commemorate his victories during the Jewish wars. For 100 days, thousands were killed in executions and gladiatorial fights. Shortly after the games ended, Titus developed a fever and died after just two turbulent years in office. \\n \\nIn 135 A.D., on the date Tisha B’Av, Roman Emperor Hadrian had another 500,000 Jews massacred at Betar during Bar Kokhba’s revolt. Emperor Hadrian believed the source of Jewish rebellion was their faith, so he executed Jewish scholars, prohibited the Torah and the Hebrew calendar, and burned the sacred scroll on the Temple Mount. There he erected a statue of himself and a statue of Jupiter \\n \\nIn an attempt to completely erase Jewish history from the land, Emperor Hadrian renamed the province of Judea “Syria Palaestina,” and renamed the city of Jerusalem “Aelia Capitolina.” Jews were banned from entering Jerusalem on pain of death. \\n \\nEmperor Hadrian’s reign was the beginning of the contraction of the Roman Empire, with Hadrian’s Wall in Britain marking the Empire’s furthest extent. Jews were later allowed to enter Jerusalem once a year to pray at the Western Wall on Tisha B’Av. \\n \\nThe land of Israel was subsequently invaded or occupied by: \\n 135 A.D. Roman Empire  390 A.D. Byzantine Empire  614 A.D. Sassanid Persians  635 A.D. Umayyad Caliphate  750 A.D. Abbasid Caliphate  909 A.D. Fatimid Caliphate  1071 A.D. Seljuk Turks  1099 A.D. Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem  1187 A.D. Ayyubid Sultanate  1260 A.D. Mongolian Empire  1291 A.D. Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt  1517 A.D. Ottoman Sultanate  1660 A.D. Druze Dynasty  1799 A.D. French Napoleon  1844 A.D. Tanzimat Ottoman Empire  1864 A.D. Ottoman Vilayet of Syria  1917 A.D. Britain Mandate  \\nFor centuries, people across the world desired to pilgrimage to Jerusalem, including Abraham Lincoln. \\n \\nThe Library of Congress has a scrapbook with an account by Rev. N.W. Miner of Springfield, who officiated at Lincoln’s burial, in which are recalled President Lincoln’s last words while at Ford’s Theater with his wife: “Mrs. Lincoln informed me that … the very last moments of his conscious life were spent in conversation with her about his future plans. … He said he wanted to visit the Holy Land and see those places hallowed by the footprints of the Saviour. He was saying there was no city he so much desired to see as Jerusalem.” \\n \\nDiscover more of Bill Federer’s eye-opening books and videos in the WND Superstore! \\n \\nIn 1917, Britain issued the Balfour Declaration establishing the Jewish homeland. On May 14, 1948, the state of Israel came into being again. After the 1967 War, Jerusalem was once again under Jewish control. Jerusalem was reaffirmed as Israel’s capital with “The Basic Law: Jerusalem, the Capital of Israel,” passed in 1980. \\n \\nAs the Roman Empire experienced disasters when it forced Jews from the land, a series of coincidences have been compiled relating to the United States and Israel: \\n On Oct. 30, 1991, President George H.W. Bush signed the Oslo Accord pressuring Israel to give “land for peace.” The next day, “the Perfect Storm” hit New England, causing damages over $100 million, including 30 foot waves demolishing the home of President George H.W. Bush at Kennebunkport, Maine.  On Aug. 23, 1992, President George H.W. Bush pressured Israel with the Madrid “land for peace” agreement. The same day, Hurricane Andrew smashed into Florida, causing $30 billion in damages, destroying over 180,000 homes.  On Jan. 16, 1994, President Bill Clinton met in Geneva with Syria’s President Hafez el-Assad to discuss Israel giving up the Golan Heights in exchange for peace. Within 24 hours, a 6.9 earthquake devastated Southern California.  On Jan. 21, 1998, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was snubbed at the White House when President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright refused to have lunch with him. The same day, the Monica Lewinsky scandal erupted.  On Sept. 28, 1998, Secretary of State Albright detailed another “land for peace” agreement requiring Israel to surrender 13 percent of the West Bank and Gaza. President Clinton met with Yasser Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, followed by Arafat telling the United Nations there would soon be a Palestinian state. The same day, Hurricane Georges hit the Gulf Coast, causing $1 billion in damages.  On Oct. 15, 1998, Yassar Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu met in Maryland to discuss Israel giving up 13 percent of the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for “peace.” Two days later, tornadoes hit Texas, leaving $1 billion in damages.  On Dec. 12, 1998, President Clinton arrived in the Palestinian area to discuss Israel giving up “land for peace.” The same day, President Clinton was impeached.  On May 3, 1999, Yasser Arafat had scheduled a press conference to announce a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital. The same day, the most powerful tornado storms to hit the United States whipped through Oklahoma and Kansas.  On June 8, 2001, President George W. Bush sent Secretary Tenet to Jerusalem with a proposal to exchange land for a “Roadmap to Peace.” The same day, tropical storm Allison hit Texas, causing $7 billion in damage and closing George Bush Airport for two days.  As part of a U.S. brokered deal, Jews were forcibly evacuated from Gaza, with the last Jewish residents being dragged out on Aug. 22, 2005. The very next day, a tropical depression in the Atlantic turned into Hurricane Katrina and headed straight for New Orleans, forcing tens of thousands to evacuate. Property damage in New Orleans exceeded $81 billion. Nearly 2,000 people died. It was one of the deadliest hurricanes in U.S. history. Instead of “peace,” Hamas took over Gaza and began digging tunnels and firing thousands of rockets into Israel.  \\nIn a day of prayer and remembrance, Sept. 8, 2005, President Bush stated: “Hurricane Katrina was one of the worst natural disasters in our nation’s history and has caused unimaginable devastation and heartbreak throughout the Gulf Coast Region. … Communities … decimated. … Lives … lost. … Hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans are suffering great hardship.” \\n \\nThough not a call to repentance as past presidents had proclaimed, President Bush did end his day of prayer and remembrance with: “To honor the memory of those who lost their lives, to provide comfort and strength to families of the victims. … I call upon all Americans to pray to Almighty God and to perform acts of service. … Across our nation, many selfless deeds reflect the promise of the Scripture: ‘For I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in.’” \\n \\nBrought to you by AmericanMinute.com . \\n \\nDiscover more of Bill Federer’s eye-opening books and videos in the WND Superstore! \\n          Text smaller   Text bigger', 'source': 'WorldNetDaily', 'title': 'What happens when you mess with Israel?'}, '_index': 'news', '_type': 'sm'}, 'd909ba08-7bbb-41e1-84c7-d155018b69ba': {'_id': 'AVZ493Ahy1kBQQb2F5oD', '_score': 0.9041866, '_source': {'media-type': 'News', 'id': 'd909ba08-7bbb-41e1-84c7-d155018b69ba', 'published': '2015-09-24T11:44:28Z', 'content': '(NAPSI)—Year after year, millions of Americans face danger from major storms, natural disasters and threatening power outages.

But weather scientists are recording water temperatures in the Pacific nearing the highest they\\'ve ever seen, suggesting El Niño will open an atmospheric fire hose in the jet stream this winter.

Crews were out last week shoring up the creek\\'s banks, and if the water gets dangerously high this winter, they will be back with sandbags and inflatable flood walls -- berms filled, perversely, with water.\\n\\nIn the heart of tech-savvy Silicon Valley, the preposterously low-tech burlap bag filled with sand remains the most sophisticated weapon to fight flooding. \"Short of actually building a big engineered solution,\" JPA Executive Director Len Materman said, \"sandbags are the tried-and-true solution.\"\\n\\nThe East Bay Municipal Utility District, which has no responsibility for flood control, maintains a stockpile of sandbags to prevent its water treatment plant from being flooded by an El Niño monsoon. \"There\\'s a lot of talk about what needs to be done this fall to be ready for it,\" Abby Figueroa, the district\\'s spokeswoman, said. \"It\\'s on everyone\\'s mind.\"\\n\\nOn an average day, the west Oakland water treatment plant gets about 60 million gallons of wastewater. During the sort of unhalting storms El Niño can bring, groundwater leaks into cracks in the sewer pipes and the volume of wastewater can triple, overwhelming the system and sensitive noses near the Bay Bridge. Figueroa said if the plant\\'s capacity remains maxed out for too long, it releases \"partially treated sewage\" into the bay.\\n\\nFour years of dry winters have lulled many homeowners into a false sense of security about the fitness of their roofs to withstand an El Niño pounding, said Jeff Tamayo, co-owner of Town & Country Roofing in Brentwood. His company would hire 25 additional workers if Tamayo could find them, which is why his crews are booked two months out.\\n\\n\"What happens historically is people wait for it to start raining before they call for a roof repair,\" he said. \"And by then it\\'s too late. We\\'ll be a month to six weeks out before we can get to them. With a heavy downpour and strong winds, things that should never, ever leak all of sudden leak very bad.\"\\n\\nOf course, there is no guarantee the coming storms will deliver the marauding moisture marinade that will recharge aquifers, refill reservoirs and leave a sable of snow in the Sierra to melt our troubles away. \"All the forecasts we\\'ve seen so far are about El Niño conditions. They\\'re not rainfall forecasts,\" meteorologist Jan Null, of Golden Gate Weather Services, said. \"We don\\'t know what we\\'re going to get.\"\\n\\nThe faster one storm is followed by another, the less water the ground can absorb, causing the kind of runoff that led to 33 landslides along Portola Valley\\'s Alpine Road during the \\'97-98 El Niño storms. Because Kevin Fisher lives in what the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated a floodplain, he is part of the tiny fraction of Californians who have flood insurance. About 8.3 million homeowner policies were in effect in 2011, according to the Association of California Insurance Companies, a private trade association, and yet as of this year only 232,651 of those included flood coverage. That\\'s 3.6 percent, compared to the 10 percent who carry earthquake insurance.\\n\\n\"Flood is not covered in a homeowners insurance policy,\" said Nicole Mahrt Ganley, the group\\'s spokeswoman. \"People talk about getting physically prepared for disaster, but they don\\'t always talk about being financially prepared. Even if you\\'re not required to have it, that doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s not a good idea.\" And flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period to take effect. \\n\\nAlong the bone-dry banks of the San Francisquito, you can almost hear the lyrics of the old Johnny Cash song, If the good Lord\\'s willing and the creeks don\\'t rise. Fisher doesn\\'t know the words, but he\\'s heard the tune before. \"Of course I\\'m worried,\" he said. \"We all are.\"\\n\\nContact Bruce Newman at 408-920-5004.

Vice President Joe Biden canceled a Saturday event in Virginia and one scheduled for Monday in New Hampshire. Both campaigns cited a desire not to use resources better targeted toward pre-storm preparations.\\nCrowley: Sandy introduces big unknown into campaign\\nAnn Romney, who was slated to campaign in New Hampshire on Monday, canceled her events, and the Romney campaign said the bus that was to be used for her visit would instead be deployed for \"relief efforts throughout the East Coast.\" Both campaigns said they were suspending fundraising e-mails to supporters in Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey and the District of Columbia.\\nObama canceled trips to the battlegrounds of Ohio and Colorado to stay in Washington and monitor the oncoming storm, though a campaign trip to Florida remained on the president\\'s schedule for Monday.\\nRomney is scheduled to campaign in Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin on Monday, then in Ohio on Tuesday.

Hurricane Isaac forced the cancellation of the first day of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, in August.\\nAsked whether the Romney campaign felt snake-bitten by Mother Nature, Madden said, \"Well, there\\'s certain things we can\\'t control and nature\\'s one of them. So we just try to have focus on what we can control and part of what we can control is making sure that safety is a priority for the people that are in harm\\'s way in some of these states that are going to be directly impacted and so that\\'s a top concern and it\\'ll remain a top concern.\"\\nWhile the political experts navigated the ramifications of the storm, at least one campaign had more practical matters in mind.

(Patrick Tehan/Bay Area News Group) ( Patrick Tehan )\\n\\nThe roar of chain saws is likely to get louder this winter as PG&E crews respond to power outages caused by the drought-weakened timber. \"I think we\\'ve had 5,000 major trees die,\" said Gary Kremen, chairman of the board of the Santa Clara Valley Water District, which for months has been urging its customers to conserve water, and now must prepare to provide them with sandbags for flood control -- in a very real sense the sky is falling. \\n\\nEveryone wants this to be the deluge that douses the drought, but too much rain coming down too fast could sink low-lying communities like Alviso, East Palo Alto and Fisher\\'s neighborhood, which is a mile and a half southeast of San Francisquito Creek. \\n\\n\"Lives are at stake when it floods in East Palo Alto,\" Kremen said. \"In the 1998 flood, people almost died there. And it\\'s going to come. We will get some floods.\"\\n\\n\"What people don\\'t realize is that San Francisquito Creek drains 40 square miles of the Santa Cruz Mountains,\" says Fisher, an engineer, who had a narrow middle-of-the-night escape the last time, carrying his two small children, dog and elderly mother-in-law to a neighbor\\'s SUV after his family vehicles were flooded. \\n\\nThat night, the city of Palo Alto \"got caught totally flat-footed,\" Fisher said. \"They didn\\'t have a clue.\" Since then, an auto-dialer system to alert residents that the creek could flood has been installed, and a monitoring system allows anyone to watch the creek rise on their computer. \"But it\\'s been nearly 20 years,\" Fisher said, \"and truthfully, in terms of the flood risk, there\\'s been zero change. I think another flood would just about do us in.\"\\n\\nJonathan Castillo, a roofer with Town and County Roofing and Solar, installs a roof on a home in Alamo, Calif., on Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2015. The prospect of a heavy winter deluge from El Nino-driven rain has homeowners scrambling to get the roofs on their homes buttoned up and roofers say business is the best it\\'s been in years. (Anda Chu/Bay Area News Group) ( ANDA CHU )\\n\\nTo prevent anybody being done in by the next El Niño, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties created the Joint Powers Authority (JPA), which has taken a special interest in the Pope-Chaucer Street Bridge, a chokepoint on San Francisquito Creek that sits at the juncture of Palo Alto, Menlo Park and East Palo Alto. Crews were out last week shoring up the creek\\'s banks, and if the water gets dangerously high this winter, they will be back with sandbags and inflatable flood walls -- berms filled, perversely, with water.\\n\\nIn the heart of tech-savvy Silicon Valley, the preposterously low-tech burlap bag filled with sand remains the most sophisticated weapon to fight flooding. \"Short of actually building a big engineered solution,\" JPA Executive Director Len Materman said, \"sandbags are the tried-and-true solution.\"\\n\\nThe East Bay Municipal Utility District, which has no responsibility for flood control, maintains a stockpile of sandbags to prevent its water treatment plant from being flooded by an El Niño monsoon. \"There\\'s a lot of talk about what needs to be done this fall to be ready for it,\" Abby Figueroa, the district\\'s spokeswoman, said. \"It\\'s on everyone\\'s mind.\"\\n\\nOn an average day, the west Oakland water treatment plant gets about 60 million gallons of wastewater. During the sort of unhalting storms El Niño can bring, groundwater leaks into cracks in the sewer pipes and the volume of wastewater can triple, overwhelming the system and sensitive noses near the Bay Bridge. Figueroa said if the plant\\'s capacity remains maxed out for too long, it releases \"partially treated sewage\" into the bay.\\n\\nFour years of dry winters have lulled many homeowners into a false sense of security about the fitness of their roofs to withstand an El Niño pounding, said Jeff Tamayo, co-owner of Town & Country Roofing in Brentwood. His company would hire 25 additional workers if Tamayo could find them, which is why his crews are booked two months out.\\n\\n\"What happens historically is people wait for it to start raining before they call for a roof repair,\" he said. \"And by then it\\'s too late. We\\'ll be a month to six weeks out before we can get to them. With a heavy downpour and strong winds, things that should never, ever leak all of sudden leak very bad.\"\\n\\nOf course, there is no guarantee the coming storms will deliver the marauding moisture marinade that will recharge aquifers, refill reservoirs and leave a sable of snow in the Sierra to melt our troubles away. \"All the forecasts we\\'ve seen so far are about El Niño conditions. They\\'re not rainfall forecasts,\" meteorologist Jan Null, of Golden Gate Weather Services, said. \"We don\\'t know what we\\'re going to get.\"\\n\\nThe faster one storm is followed by another, the less water the ground can absorb, causing the kind of runoff that led to 33 landslides along Portola Valley\\'s Alpine Road during the \\'97-98 El Niño storms. Because Kevin Fisher lives in what the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated a floodplain, he is part of the tiny fraction of Californians who have flood insurance. About 8.3 million homeowner policies were in effect in 2011, according to the Association of California Insurance Companies, a private trade association, and yet as of this year only 232,651 of those included flood coverage. That\\'s 3.6 percent, compared to the 10 percent who carry earthquake insurance.\\n\\n\"Flood is not covered in a homeowners insurance policy,\" said Nicole Mahrt Ganley, the group\\'s spokeswoman. \"People talk about getting physically prepared for disaster, but they don\\'t always talk about being financially prepared. Even if you\\'re not required to have it, that doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s not a good idea.\" And flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period to take effect. \\n\\nAlong the bone-dry banks of the San Francisquito, you can almost hear the lyrics of the old Johnny Cash song, If the good Lord\\'s willing and the creeks don\\'t rise. Fisher doesn\\'t know the words, but he\\'s heard the tune before. \"Of course I\\'m worried,\" he said. \"We all are.\"\\n\\nContact Bruce Newman at 408-920-5004.

FILE PHOTO Most residents know how to prepare for an emergency: have an escape route the entire family is aware of, keep supplies packed in an easily accessible backpack, make sure flashlights and radios have batteries. \\n \\nThe New Jersey Department of Agriculture has put forth a plan to protect animals as well in case of an emergency. \\n \\nA recently launched website at www.animalemergency.nj.gov , is designed to provide members of the public with up-to-theminute information they would need to protect their pets and livestock in times of emergency via computer, smart phones or mobile tablet devices. \\n \\nThe website comes just in time for hurricane season; also, September is National Disaster Preparedness Month. \\n \\nPet owners should prepare a general emergency kit that includes gauze pads, antiseptic wipes, hydrogen peroxide, scissors, tweezers, a blanket, food and water in case a situation such as a hurricane or fire occurs. FILE PHOTO “New Jersey has faced many emergencies, both large and small, in the last several years, and we know that people feel very strongly about protecting their animals in those situations,” New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H. Fisher said. “Our new website gives folks the resources they need to care for their animals in those trying times and also keep themselves safe in the process.” \\n \\nThe site is interactive, allowing people to simply type in their location to find the nearest help available, including animal shelters, veterinary hospitals, emergency management offices, feed stores, county fairgrounds and Rutgers Cooperative Extension offices. \\n \\nIn the event of an emergency, a “ticker” will be visible on the home page displaying real-time messages. “We learned a lot from past disasters, such as superstorm Sandy, and we know that preparing ahead of time for such events will make things easier not only for animal owners but also first-responders,” said Dr. Manoel Tamassia, New Jersey state veterinarian. “We ask that everyone spread the word and bookmark this site on your home computers, tablets and smart phones.” \\n \\nThe website will also include information about each county’s County Animal Response Team (CART). \\n  \\nVolunteers with Middlesex CART assisted in caring for dogs and cats during Hurricane Irene in 2011, superstorm Sandy in 2012 and the massive warehouse fire in North Brunswick in July, according to the Middlesex County Department of Public Safety and Health, among other emergency situations. \\n \\n“We know people’s pets are important to them,” said Middlesex County Freeholder H. James Polos, chairman of the county’s Public Safety and Health Committee. “Offering shelters to which people can bring their beloved pets gives them a sense of comfort in a time of chaos.” \\n \\nAs long as the pets are vaccinated and are not aggressive or sick, they can remain under the care of veterinarians, animal control officers, veterinary technicians and other animal professionals such as trainers or groomers for as long as the shelter is open, according to the department. \\n \\nSince CART is a bureau under the county’s Office of Emergency Management, it can be deployed immediately regardless of the American Red Cross, officials said. \\n \\n“Our residents’ safety and well-being is paramount in any emergency situation,” Middlesex County Freeholder Director Ronald G. Rios said. “Knowing that they can bring their pets with them will alleviate some anxiety and may allow people to evacuate to a shelter more quickly.” \\n \\nCART is also prepared to respond to other emergencies besides sheltering, such as assisting with hoarding situations, animal rescues, transportation accidents involving animals, etc. \\n \\nAnother resource available to the technologically savvy is the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals’ (ASPCA) mobile app to help pet owners be prepared. \\n \\nWith a few swipes, the user can access critical advice on what to do with pets before, during and after a major storm, receive a personalized pet recovery kit, build a lost pet digital flier that can be shared instantly on social media and receive the latest news on animal welfare. \\n \\nThe app is available in the App Store and Google Play. \\n \\nHowever, prior to needing emergency resources, humans can protect their canine and feline counterparts by taking precautionary measures. \\n \\nDiana Sichta, secretary of the North Brunswick Humane Association, suggested that pet owners pack a pet first aid and emergency kit, have emergency phone numbers handy, have their pet microchipped and take a pet first aid class. \\n \\n“Keep a detailed account of your pet. A pet journal that includes vaccines, emergency numbers, medications, etc., is a good way to ensure proper care of your pet with or without you. Make sure you keep it in an accessible place, in case you need it fast,” she said. \\n \\n“Take a picture of you with your pet in case you are separated. You might need it for ID when visiting or for the return of your pet. \\n \\n“Prepare for an emergency before any emergency by deciding where, when and what you will need before you need to do it.” she said. \\n \\nMichael Azzarello, a credentialed veterinary technician and instructor of the Veterinary Assistant Program at Brookdale \\n \\nCommunity College, Lincroft, said pets are susceptible to broken nails, cut paw pads, foreign body obstruction, bloat, heat-related emergencies and poisoning. \\n \\nGeneral emergency kits should include gauze pads, adhesive tape, antiseptic wipes, hydrogen peroxide, an ice pack, disposable gloves, a rectal thermometer, scissors, tweezers, towels, a pillowcase, a blanket and a pet carrier, in addition to food and water. \\n \\n“If owners are aware of an impending natural disaster, [they] should already have a pre-plan established on what they will do if they have to evacuate their residence. Locations that take pets, such as hotels, should already be included in your first aid kits. \\n \\n“You should check your feed supply and make sure you have an ample amount to get your pets through the disaster and at least one week after. Many stores aren’t going to be open after a major disaster, and finding your pets’ food could be tough. You don’t want to cause more health issues by changing your dog’s food drastically and making them vomit or have diarrhea,” said Azzarello, who is also the owner of Life Training Associates of Old Bridge. \\n \\n“Once the emergency is under control, an owner should restock the emergency kit, follow and complete their veterinarian’s recommendations, and learn from what had happened.” \\n \\nIt is also imperative for the pet owner to stay calm during an emergency situation. \\n \\n“Although it is very hard to understand what our animals are thinking … my thoughts would be an animal’s biggest issue during an emergency is fear. They also can sense our feelings much better than we think. The more excited a person gets, the more stressed our pets could become. \\n \\n“In addition, our normal, kind, loving pet could become aggressive during an emergency or, even worse, bite you or someone else that is trying to help. You should attempt to muzzle your pet during trauma or injury when attempting to give first aid. … If we think for a second about our animals’ ancestors, for instance the wolf, instinctively animals that are hurt are easy prey for a bigger predator. So, of course our pets are going to be scared when they are injured,” he said. \\n \\nIn order to minimize the stress of an emergency situation, Azzarello insisted that planning ahead is key. \\n \\n“You don’t want to put yourself at risk trying to make last-minute arrangements or having to go out and get pet items because you didn’t plan ahead. Remember, in the end, you can’t help your pet if you get hurt or worse,” he said. \\n \\nFor more information, visit the website at www.the dailymews.com/lifestyle/feline-fitness/pet-first-aid. aspcapro.org/sites/default/files/ready_pets_brochure.pdf or www.fema.gov/news-release/2011/12/01/disaster-planyour pets.', 'source': 'Hub', 'title': 'Protecting pets when disaster strikes'}, '_index': 'news', '_type': 'sm'}, '2321198ad46ca314807839fc240885ab019219c1': {'_id': 'AVaFQRo7y1kBQQb2GQXV', '_score': 0.70115364, '_source': {'media-type': 'News', 'published': '2013-11-23T10:06:00Z', 'id': '2321198ad46ca314807839fc240885ab019219c1', 'source': 'nst', 'title': 'Philippines typhoon death toll feared to hit 7,000', 'content': \"23 November 2013| last updated at 07:37PM\\nPhilippines typhoon death toll feared to hit 7,000\\n0 comments\\nTACLOBAN, Philippines: The number of people dead or missing after one of the world\\x92s strongest typhoons struck the Philippines climbed towards 7,000 on Saturday, as the United Nations warned much more needed to be done to help desperate survivors.\\nThe government\\x92s confirmed death toll rose to 5,235, with another 1,613 people still missing more than two weeks after Super Typhoon Haiyan destroyed entire towns across a long stretch of islands in the central Philippines.\\n \\nHaiyan now rivals a 1976 tsunami on the southern island of Mindanao as the deadliest recorded natural disaster to strike the Philippines, which endures a never-ending battle against typhoons, earthquakes, floods and volcanic eruptions.\\n \\nThe typhoon has triggered a giant, international aid effort, with dozens of countries and relief organisations rushing to deliver food, water and health services to more than four million people who lost their homes.\\n \\nHowever UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos, after visiting the disaster zones, warned the world was still not responding fast enough.\\n \\n\\x93Much more needs to be done.

By August, an inferno was stirring in the forests east of the Cascades. A wind-whipped blaze near the mountain town of Twisp, Washington — a \"hell storm,\" to quote a local sheriff — claimed the lives of three Forest Service fire scouts. That blaze soon exploded into the worst wildfire in state history, charring more than 300,000 acres and destroying dozens of homes. \\n Sidebar    Apocalypse Soon: 9 Terrifying Signs of Environmental Doom »  \\nAs they raged, the wildfires in eastern Oregon and Washington devoured an area nearly the size of Delaware. The states called up more than 1,000 members of their National Guards, and the Army mobilized 200 active-duty troops to the fire lines. Ten Blackhawk helicopters and four C-130 Hercules aircraft deployed to help fight fire from the skies. With Gov. Jay Inslee calling the blazes an \"unprecedented cataclysm,\" Washington even deputized citizen volunteers to fight the fires, where they joined professional crews from as far away as Australia and New Zealand. \\n \\nThis is the present, and the future, of climate change. Our overheated world is amplifying drought and making megafire commonplace. This is happening even in the soggy Pacific Northwest, which has been hard-hit by what\\'s been dubbed a \"wet drought.\" Despite near-normal precipitation, warm winter temperatures brought rain instead of snow to the region\\'s mountains. What little snow did hit the ground then melted early, leaving the Northwest dry — and ready to burn in the heat of summer. \\n \\nThe national data is as clear as it is troubling: \"Climate change has led to fire seasons that are now on average 78 days longer than in 1970,\" according to a Forest Service report published in August. In the past three decades, the annual area claimed by fire has doubled, and the agency\\'s scientists predict that fires will likely \"double again by midcentury.\" \\n Sidebar    How Climate Change May Alter Forests Worldwide »  \\nThe human imprint on the bone-dry conditions that lead to fire is real — and now measurable. According to a major new study by scientists at Columbia and NASA, man-made warming is increasing atmospheric evaporation — drawing water out of Western soil, shrubs and trees. In California alone, the epic drought is up to 25 percent more severe than it would have been, absent climate change. And this impact doesn\\'t respect state borders. The study\\'s lead author, Columbia scientist Park Williams, tells Rolling Stone , \"There\\'s the same effect in the Pacific Northwest.\" \\n \\nStanding near fire lines in late August, Inslee vowed to extinguish the blazes in his state. But the governor also called on Americans to confront an enemy fiercer and more insidious than fire itself. He declared, \"We\\'ve got to attack this at its source: carbon pollution.\" \\n \\nT he fiery future is upon us. Pervasive drought and record temperatures — July was the warmest month ever physically recorded on planet Earth — have turned forests from Fresno to Fairbanks into tinderboxes. In Alaska, more than 5 million acres burned — surpassing the 10-year average for the entire country. With months left in the fire season, the blazes of 2015 have already scorched more than 8 million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center — a record pace, likely to top the 9.8 million acres that burned in 2006. \"Some of these fires that are in these forested areas could burn until it snows,\" said NIFC spokeswoman Jessica Gardetto. \\n \\nSteep reductions in greenhouse pollution can lessen the danger going forward, as Inslee suggests. But the dark reality is that significant future burning has already been locked in. In parts of the West, very large fires will increase sixfold by midcentury, according to a new study from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. With our nation\\'s firefighting resources tapped out by the fires of the present, America finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire. \\n \\nFor a glimpse of the future, look north, to Alaska and the Arctic — which President Obama, during a visit to Anchorage this summer, highlighted as \"the leading edge of climate change.\" Soaring temperatures and an early-melting snowpack have brought raging wildfires to landscapes that have not been kissed by flame for millennia. \"Climate change is no longer some far-off problem,\" Obama declared. \"It is happening here. It is happening now.\" \\n \\nThe world is warming most toward the poles, and temperatures in Alaska have been increasing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the country in the past 60 years — up almost three degrees. And the state\\'s average fire season has increased by more than a month — 35 days — since the 1950s. \"We can detect the climate-change influence on fire,\" says Glenn Juday, a forest ecologist at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, who points to three indicators all on the upswing: \"the area burned, the severity of the burning and then the frequency.\"\\xa0 \\n Winds blew acrid smoke from Western fires as far as Atlanta, creating hazardous air quality. John Grimwade  \\nThe tragedy of climate-driven megafire is that the fires themselves worsen global warming by pumping megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is especially true north of the Arctic Circle. For the past 5,000 years, the Arctic Alaskan tundra was too frigid and too wet to support significant wildfire. That changed in 2007, when a massive blaze ripped through Alaska\\'s North Slope. The fire burned more than 400 square miles, not only charring a pristine landscape, but setting off a greenhouse bomb, igniting organic matter in the soil that had lain dormant for centuries. This single fire released as much carbon dioxide into the air as the Arctic\\'s entire tundra ecosystem, including the northern reaches of Canada and Russia, had absorbed in the previous quarter century. Scientists long considered the tundra the \"most secure storehouse of carbon — fixed carbon, keeping it out of the atmosphere — that you could possibly think of,\" says Juday. \"It was frozen — and a thick mat of it. We never thought a big chunk of it would burn. It\\'s astounding.\" What\\'s worse: Tundra fire also thins the soil layer that insulates permafrost, further destabilizing this terrifying reserve of greenhouse gases. \\n \\nThis summer, Alaska was set to burn due to an unusually warm winter combined with a pitiful snowfall. (Anchorage recorded barely two feet of snow — shattering a record that had held up for 60 years.) With spring came soaring temperatures: more than seven degrees above average statewide. The city of Eagle, Alaska, 200 miles east of Fairbanks, hit 91 degrees in May — a higher temperature than had been recorded to that date in either Houston or Dallas. \\n \\nWhen lightning struck, Alaska blazed. \"At one point this summer,\" Obama noted, \"more than 300 wildfires were burning at once.\" Blazing largely out of control, the fires consumed 5.1 million acres — the second-worst fire season on record. As bad as wildfire has been in Alaska, it will only get worse, according to the National Climate Assessment, the 2014 federal report that gauges regional risks of climate change. Assume everything goes right at climate talks this year in Paris; assume world governments leap to action with aggressive measures to curb carbon emissions — even under this scenario, according to the report, Alaska wildfire will double by 2050 and triple by 2100. \\n \\nA s worldwide temperatures rise, wildfires will only increase. But what is less intuitive is how a dangerous drought and fire season have gripped the Pacific Northwest — despite annual precipitation levels that were close to normal. The problem, it turns out, was not a lack of water, but rather that so little of it fell as snow. \\n \\nUnder typical conditions, deep mountain snowpacks and late spring stream runoff give protection from wildfire by keeping trees and vegetation moist far into summers that can run hot and dry — particularly east of the Cascade Mountains. This winter, temperatures soared 5.6 degrees above normal in the region, leading to record-low snowpack, and to stream runoff that peaked, in many places, in the dead of February. In March, Inslee declared a statewide drought emergency in Washington. By June, the snowpack was just\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009gone. \\n \\n\"This drought is unlike any we\\'ve ever experienced,\" Maia Bellon, the director of Washington state\\'s Department of Ecology, said in May. It has primed the region to burn. Susan Prichard, a fire ecologist at the University of Washington, says the sudden drying of overgrown forests created a \"perfect storm\" for big fires in eastern Oregon and Washington. \"It leads us,\" she says, \"to a tinderbox situation.\" \\n \\nThe warming air is sucking the forests dry — literally. Man-made higher temperatures increase the atmosphere\\'s appetite for moisture; Williams, the Columbia climate scientist, jokes that the effect is like a Mafia shakedown, with the air constantly demanding more water from the land. In wet years, the atmosphere\\'s increased thirst doesn\\'t matter much. But in times of drought, this tax on the water system is significant and damaging. \"That cost is now becoming large enough that it\\'s really detectable,\" Williams says, \"and it\\'s reducing water availability for humans and ecosystems.\" \\n \\nJoe Casola, deputy director of the Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington, points to the future. This year\\'s combination of warm winter, low snowpack, early runoff, hot summer and fire is straight from the textbook — \"a good preview,\" he says, of what climate models tell us will soon be commonplace. \"These are the conditions we\\'re likely to be facing several decades from now and going forward.\"\\xa0 \\n A detailed look at the 2015 fire season – one of the worst on record. John Grimwade  \\nAccording to current EPA projections, April snowpack in the Cascades will shrink by as much as 40 percent by 2040. \"Higher summer temperatures, earlier spring snow melt and potential reductions in summer soil moisture would contribute to wildfire risk,\" the agency concludes. \\n \\nBy 2080, according to the National Climate Assessment, the median acreage burned in Pacific Northwest wildfires is likely to quadruple. So what does that mean on the ground? Instead of a once-in-20-years event, the type of megafires now ravaging Oregon and Washington could be expected to occur one year out of every two. \\n \\nI f fire is inevitable, there\\'s a glint of good news: America can get much smarter about how it fights wildfire, by making simple changes to the funding of the Forest Service. \"We all agree that the way wildfire management has been funded is broken,\" Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said in August. \"It is past time that we fix it.\" \\n \\nWith surprising ease, you can track climate change in the portion of the Forest Service budget that\\'s spent fighting fire. In 1995, it was only 16 percent. This year — for the first time ever — more than 50 percent of the budget will go to firefighting. Ten years from now, the agency projects, these costs will balloon to become two-thirds of the budget. \\n \\nThe situation has become so dire that the Forest Service now robs its fire-prevention budget — money for clearing brush, thinning forests and conducting \"prescribed burns\" that help prevent future megablazes — just to fund its firefighting. The exploding cost of combating fire is \"crippling\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009the very programs and restoration projects that reduce the fire threat,\" the agency reports. \\n \\nIn its wisdom, Congress has set the Forest Service budget on the basis of a 10-year average cost. That formula worked well enough with a more stable climate. But the agency has been saddled with ever-increasing, and increasingly costly, megafire. \"The six worst fire seasons since 1960,\" the agency reported in August, \"have all occurred since 2000.\" \\n \\nWith the Northwest ablaze, Congress is responding. The reform effort is championed by Western lawmakers, including, ironically, Republicans who have either denied climate change exists, like Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming, or fought controls on greenhouse gases, like Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. \\n \\nSimpson\\'s Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would decouple the agency\\'s budget from the cost of fighting megafires. Only one percent of blazes are now driving 30 percent of costs. Under Simpson\\'s plan, fighting megafires would instead be funded out of the $12 billion federal disaster relief fund — the same kitty that FEMA taps when it provides relief from hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. \\n \\nOregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, is insisting he\\'ll push the issue to the forefront when Congress reconvenes this month. \"My first order of business,\" he said, \"is to end the terrible trifecta that makes these fires worse: underfunding firefighting budgets, stealing money from fire prevention to make up the shortfall and letting hazardous fuels build up as a result.\" \\n \\nA s the nation reframes its thinking about wildfire — from the routine natural burns of 50 years ago to today\\'s climate-aggravated megablazes —\\xa0it is crucial not to overlook the worst-case scenario: a major metropolis engulfed in fire. \\n \\nAmerica has seen previews of this catastrophe: In 1991, a wildfire swept into the hills and canyons above Oakland, overwhelming firefighters, claiming 25 lives, injuring 150 other people and causing more than $1.5 billion in property damage. The 2003 Cedar Fire, driven by Southern California\\'s fierce Santa Ana winds, scorched more than 280,000 acres. The worst fire in the state record books, the October blaze reached into the suburbs of San Diego, burning more than 2,200 homes. Wildfire hit again in 2007, forcing thousands of residents to take refuge in Qualcomm Stadium, the venue where the NFL\\'s Chargers play. \\n \\nIn a small blessing, the record fire season in the Pacific Northwest this summer has been relatively limited in its human and financial costs. The affected region is sparsely populated forest and rangeland, separated from Seattle and Portland by a major mountain range. But the fires\\' secondary effects on these cities shouldn\\'t be discounted: In late August, shifting winds funneled dangerous smoke from multiple fires down through the Columbia Gorge, temporarily turning Portland into a smoke box. Particulate concentrations in the city\\'s air reached \"unhealthy\" levels usually not seen outside Beijing. \\n \\nBut in the big picture, America was lucky that wildfire hadn\\'t struck the parched hills of Silicon Valley, or swept down through Colorado\\'s Front Range into the suburbs west of Denver. Indeed, Northern California skirted disaster in July. The Rocky Fire — sparked by a decrepit water heater — threatened the city of Clear Lake, north of the state\\'s fabled Napa Valley, ripping through 70,000 acres, jumping a highway and subjecting 13,000 residents to evacuation orders. Ken Pimlott, the director of CAL Fire, the state\\'s fire authority, says California still faces \"unprecedented fire behavior and fuel conditions\" and that the worst of the fire season is likely \"yet to come\" in Southern California. \"We haven\\'t dodged a bullet by any stretch of the imagination,\" he says. \\n \\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown has recently been calling out the Republican presidential candidates who refuse to even acknowledge that climate change exists. \"Longer fire seasons, extreme weather and severe droughts aren\\'t on the horizon,\" he wrote in an open letter to GOP candidates. \"They\\'re all here — and here to stay.\" \\n \\nWith a lightning strike or an arsonist\\'s match, the fire next time could threaten San Jose, San Diego or the L.A. Basin — each a major engine of the national economy. At its most dangerous, warming-driven wildfire poses an existential threat. \"The climate is unstable,\" Brown told reporters in August. \"If the drought was to continue for a year or several years, California could literally burn up.\"', 'source': 'Rolling Stone', 'title': 'What Megablazes Tell Us About the Fiery Future of Climate Change 5 days ago'}, '_index': 'news', '_type': 'sm'}, 'c1d4a0d0-d767-4b47-9b66-66521503e25e': {'_id': 'AVZ49rI02qyzgx0SPb6P', '_score': 0.9041866, '_source': {'media-type': 'News', 'id': 'c1d4a0d0-d767-4b47-9b66-66521503e25e', 'published': '2015-09-24T11:44:28Z', 'content': '(NAPSI)—Year after year, millions of Americans face danger from major storms, natural disasters and threatening power outages. The increasingly unpredictable nature of weather patterns, along with threats to our infrastructure provide a warning that major headaches can occur if homeowners postpone taking the steps necessary for proper preparedness. \\n  \\n“Proper preparedness is the best way to avoid potential harm to your home and your family,” said home improvement expert and Generac partner Danny Lipford, “Since September is National Preparedness Month, it’s an especially good time to create a disaster preparedness kit. I like to store mine in a laundry basket, so all of my items are organized in one place.” \\n \\nA disaster preparedness kit should contain the following items: \\n \\n• Fresh water and nonperishable food items—enough to last for about three days. \\n \\n• NOAA weather radio to stay on top of the storm, as well as any announcements from local authorities. \\n \\n• Flashlights and fresh batteries. \\n \\n• First-aid kit and any medications that you may need to last you for several days. \\n \\n• Emergency contact numbers such as police, fire, friends or family, so you can reach out to them in an emergency and let them know you are all right. \\n \\n• Any important documentation and identification that you don’t want lost. \\n \\n• Cash in case banks are not open or are not accessible. \\n \\nIt’s also important for homeowners to purchase a source of backup power, which can save Americans from scary situations that result from power loss. Being properly prepared for weather disasters and power outages can also save money. An outage can cost a homeowner thousands of dollars in lost food, travel expenses and even property damage—all of which can be avoided by investing now in preparedness items. Generac Power Systems offers a broad range of backup power solutions, from portable generators to automatic home backup power systems to commercial and industrial generators that, in the long term, could save millions and provide peace of mind. \\n \\n“Preparing for emergency situations only works if done in advance,” Lipford said. “Take time this month to really think about the potential dangers your family could face and get a kit and action plan prepared. Purchasing a source of backup power now, before disaster strikes, means your home and family will be protected during severe storms and extended power outages. National Preparedness Month reminds us the time to prepare is now, not during or after the threat when it’s too late.” \\n \\nFor more information on Generac and its product line, visit www.generac.com .

But what grows increasingly unsettling for Finger Lakes residents is how often they’re happening in such places as Honeoye, Penn Yan, Ionia, Farmington, Phelps and Palmyra. \\nTo cope with the deluge of natural and manmade emergencies, local, state and federal agencies have ramped up efforts to equip and educate the public, starting with National Preparedness Month in September and Fire Prevention Week in October. Sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, this year’s National Preparedness Month theme is “Don’t Wait. Communicate. Make Your Emergency Plan Today.” All September, residents are being urged to create an emergency plan that they can activate in the event of a natural or manmade disaster. They’re further encouraged to prepare a portable, emergency supply kit containing enough food, water, medications and other consumables to last seven to 10 days, and to create a family emergency communications plan that includes up-to-date contact information for individuals that might need to be reached during a disaster. “When disaster strikes, we want all New Yorkers to be prepared and ready to respond,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a news release earlier this month. “By planning ahead and taking a few simple safety steps, we can all be ready for unpredictable weather conditions and emergencies.” In addition, each week of National Preparedness Month promotes a different hazard-focused theme: the first focused on flood readiness, the second on wildfire readiness, the third on hurricane preparedness, and the fourth on power outage preparedness. More than 21 million in the U.S. have already signed up to take action in their own homes on Sept. 30 — National PrepareAthon! Day. In Ontario County, Emergency Management Director Jeff Harloff said some simple preparation will help residents better handle emergencies. Just having a list of medications and the addresses and phone numbers of family members on hand can be invaluable if you have to be relocated to a shelter on short notice, he said. “Not only plan for you and your immediate family members, but also for your pets,” Harloff said. “It’s one thing we learned from Hurricane Katrina. If you look at the national coverage of wildfires out west — they’ve had very little notice to evacuate. They’re literally grabbing things as they head out.” Farmers in Ontario County especially have done a lot of planning since the last ice storm, he said. “Now they have better networks, they have another location to move livestock to, they have a food network, they’ve looked at alternative power,” he said. Page 2 of 6 - \\nThe first 24 hours \\nShortsville Fire Chief Jason Wagner has a “go bag” packed for each person in his family. They’re stored in his basement. In each are food, water, hygiene supplies, medication, medical items and other supplies. “Are you ready to live for 48 to 72 hours without power or water?” asked Wagner. “What are you going to eat? How will you cook it? Do you have the medications you’ll need? What do your children or older adults need? If you have to bug out, you’ll probably grab your phone, but will you remember a charger?” The website www.ready.gov provides strategies and checklists for families to make their emergency plan and assemble 48-hour survival kits. “People need to remember that disaster can happen here. There’s risk,” he said, adding that people need to remind themselves to check the “go bags” once a quarter and swap out the water and consumables. Under the leadership of Ontario County EMS Coordinator Debra Trickey, the county offers periodic Community Emergency Response Team training that equips individuals and families to know what to do in the first 24 hours of an emergency, before emergency services are available. “What has affected the county, state, and nation — winter storms, flooding — these are things that affect us on a regular basis,” Trickey said. “We do fire safety, fire extinguisher training, how to shut off your gas, first aid training, different types of carries using what they have available, light search and rescue, how to safely search a structure, and triage, which is sorting victims in order of the severity of their injury.” \\nGuest instructors also talk about terrorism and how it affects the state and the Finger Lakes — what’s happening locally and beyond, she said. \\n“We also touch on disaster psychology, which is learning how to deal with what you’re seeing,” Trickey said. “It’s very much a hands-on class. People walk away with a lot of knowledge, which hopefully they can apply.” The next CERT training will take place Sept. 30 through Nov. 18, on seven or eight Wednesday nights from 7 to 10 p.m. The free classes are for people 18 and older, and are designed to teach people what to do for themselves and for neighbors in the first 24 hours of an earthquake, flood or other emergency. Classes typically attract a number of Ham (amateur) radio operators, county employees, church members and people who simply want to help out in an emergency, Trickey said. CERT training, which began in 2008, is held one or two times each year and is a federal initiative administered by the county, she said. Page 3 of 6 - State education, alerts To help New Yorkers prepare for an emergency, the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, in partnership with the New York National Guard, offers periodic Citizen Preparedness Corps training courses throughout the state. So far, more than 64,000 New Yorkers have completed a preparedness training course — more than at any other time in the state’s history. “New York has had 70 federally declared disasters since 1954,” said DHSES Commissioner John Melville. “This number represents two times the national average of disasters, so it reminds all of us of the need to be prepared in the event of an emergency. Developing an emergency plan, and preparing an emergency supply kit, can help individuals become better prepared.” To find and register for a training course, or to volunteer, visit http://www.prepare.ny.gov/training-events . More training classes are added frequently. The state also maintains the NY-Alert website at http://www.nyalert.gov to help keep New Yorkers informed of a variety of hazards. This alert and notification system contains critical emergency-related information, including instructions and recommended protective actions developed in real time by emergency service personnel. NY-Alert sends individuals free messages on severe weather warnings, significant highway closures, hazardous materials spills and many other emergency conditions. It also provides response actions being taken by local and state agencies, and protective actions that individuals should take to protect themselves, their family and property. To subscribe, visit http://www.nyalert.gov , or subscribe to the state’s new mobile app, iAlertz, for the latest alerts and notifications.

When it comes to reducing the risk of fire in one’s home or business, key factors are having properly inspected heating systems and chimneys, working fire extinguishers, and well-functioning smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Shortsville Fire Chief Jason Wagner knows that the number of chimney fires is going to bump up as the weather gets colder. “If you burn wood in a fireplace or insert, you need to have that device inspected and cleaned by a professional,” Wagner said. “You haven’t operated it in several months, you don’t know where the squirrels have built their nests. It’s a gamble.” Page 4 of 6 - Canandaigua Fire Chief Mark Marentette agreed. The time to get chimneys cleaned is now, not at the last minute when everybody else is trying to get it done, he said. Only burn clean, dry firewood in a wood-burning stove or fireplace to slow creosote buildup, advised Victor Fire Marshal Robert Graham. Likewise with all heating systems: Have them professionally cleaned and maintained. Check all flue pipes for cracks, holes or rust and replace any damaged or leaking pipes, Graham said. Proper maintenance is the key to any heating system. The more efficient the appliance is operating, the less likely it is to cause a fire. Have heat tape to keep pipes from freezing? Inspect it carefully and replace any worn or frayed cords. Remove leaf debris from gutters and around tape, Graham said. And conduct a fire drill at home, he said. Children learn about Exit Drills In The Home (EDITH) during Fire Safety Week in school, so parents, grandparents and caregivers should discuss and practice escape plans with family members. Daylight Saving Time ends on Nov. 1. It’s the perfect reminder to change the batteries in carbon monoxide and smoke detectors, Wagner said. If devices are more than 10 years old or not functioning properly, replace them, he said. Unfortunately, many people don’t. “A $2 battery is a lot cheaper than a structure fire,” Wagner said. Sometimes residents also will take the batteries out of detectors after they’ve burned food on the stove or the fireplace pushes a little smoke into the room, and then they forget to replace the batteries. Then when there’s a real fire, the alarm fails to sound. This year’s Fire Prevention Week, Oct. 4-10, will spotlight the theme “Hear the beep where you sleep: every bedroom needs a working smoke alarm.” An online questionnaire distributed by the National Fire Protection Association showed that less than half (42 percent) of approximately 36,000 respondents knew that a smoke alarm should be installed in each bedroom of the home, outside each sleeping area and on every level of the home. “What a very inexpensive investment,” said Ontario County Emergency Management Director Jeff Harloff. “I can’t tell you the number of times that people tell me their first indication was when their smoke detector went off. It’s one piece of equipment that works. It’s inexpensive, and worth its weight in gold.” Another essential safety device is the fire extinguisher. Keep one in the kitchen and garage, and in rooms where there are wood stoves or fireplaces. Make sure they’re properly charged, and learn how to use them. Page 5 of 6 - “So many people have never pulled the pin and used a fire extinguisher,” said Trickey, who goes so far as to have adult students practice to familiarize themselves with the devices. In Canandaigua, Marentette took a look at two dozen of the most recent fires Canandaigua firefighters responded to. The results were compelling. “When people use a fire extinguisher and use it right, it makes a tremendous difference,” said Marentette. “In the 12 most recent fires we responded to where a fire extinguisher was used (before firefighters arrived) we were on the scene for less than an hour and a half. In the 12 most recent fires where a fire extinguisher was not used, the average time we were there was just shy of five hours. The only difference was fire extinguisher use. Our response time was the same.” It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that the length of time firefighters are on the scene of a fire is directly related to the extent of damage the home or business owner will experience. The longer firefighters are on site, the more extensive and far-reaching the fire, smoke and water damage will be. “And make sure somebody’s calling the Fire Department,” added Marentette. “If they’re by themselves, get the fire extinguisher started first, but make sure that the 911 center gets called promptly. Don’t spend a great deal of time trying to get the fire out. If there are two people, one gets people out of the house and calls 911, and the other fights the fire.” Marentette told of one business owner recently who literally had the fire extinguisher in one hand and the cell phone in the other, “and that made all the difference,” he said. As for storage, Marentette recommends that fire extinguishers be kept close to an exit. “When you have a fire extinguisher in your hand, we want the layout behind you clear so you can get out quickly if needed,” he said. \\nWagner said so many of the emergencies his department responds to are actually preventable, if only people would take time to ready their homes and automobiles for winter. \\n“People have to get their winter mind-set,” he said. “This year is supposed to be just as bad or worse than last year. We have to be ready.” Residents should also be reminded that it is illegal to burn leaves anywhere in New York, although tree limbs less than 6 inches in diameter and 8 feet in length, with attached leaves, may be burned from May 15 through March 15, in towns with a total population of less than 20,000. Page 6 of 6 - \\nBefore — and after — the storm \\nHaving prepared for and survived a natural disaster or emergency situation is a victory, to be sure. But significant challenges still lie ahead. After first responders pull away, that’s when the rebuilding process begins. Jim Wolfe of the J. James Wolfe Agency in Canandaigua urged residents to make sure their homes are insured for what it would cost to rebuild, which is more than its market value. If your house is insured for less than 80 percent of the cost to rebuild, he said, you can expect to pay significant out-of-pocket expenses in the case of a disaster. The same goes for the contents of the home — insure for the replacement value, he said. “Document all your contents — it’s huge,” Wolfe said. “Take photographs of the interior of your home, antiques and fine art. Take close-up pictures that show detail, and then store the photos outside the house somewhere, like in a safe deposit box.” Harloff said he hopes the September and October initiatives will inspire people to become better prepared to face any emergency. “The best attention we get is right after an event, whether it’s flooding or a tornado,” he said. “Immediately after that we’ve got the attention of the public, and preparation happens then because it’s fresh in their minds. The farther away you get, the less important it becomes.” Above all, residents should not be discouraged because they can’t check everything off the preparedness list right away, he said. “Any effort is better than no effort,” Harloff said. “Your preparation efforts will be different than your neighbor’s or co-worker’s. It’s not one size fits all.”', 'source': 'Fairport-East Rochester Post', 'title': 'Disaster preparedness: Ready for anything'}, '_index': 'news', '_type': 'sm'}, 'a41b0e39-7fd1-4033-a762-97adff6b6b4c': {'_id': 'AVZ499uBn-pbftzfmqEh', '_score': 0.77121055, '_source': {'media-type': 'News', 'id': 'a41b0e39-7fd1-4033-a762-97adff6b6b4c', 'published': '2015-09-16T15:13:00Z', 'content': 'For over 15 years, Kevin Tuno was the calm voice at the helm of Burlington County\\'s response to almost every manner of disaster. \\n  \\nBe it hurricanes, floods, fires, blizzards or terrorist attacks, the Burlington City resident was front and center directing responders and volunteers to make rescues, set up shelters, evacuate homes and buildings, and do whatever necessary to protect lives and property. \\n \\nThe longtime Burlington County emergency management coordinator died Tuesday from complications associated with a battle with cancer. Tuno, who was also the former chief of the Young American Fire Co. in Burlington City, was 56. \\n \\n\"He devoted his life to emergency management. He was one of those quiet, reserved leaders who knew how to get things done,\" former Burlington County Freeholder Jim Wujcik said Tuesday. \"He lived and breathed emergency services and made it his life\\'s mission to ensure the public safety of each and every resident would be accomplished without a hitch.\" \\n \\nTuno began his career with the county as an emergency dispatcher in 1982, and reached the post of supervisor before being promoted to OEM coordinator in 1999. \\n \\nDuring his 16 years as coordinator, Tuno led the county\\'s response during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the devastating 2004 flood and dam breaks, Superstorm Sandy, and several other emergencies. He was also one of the key leaders who helped direct the county\\'s emergency communications upgrades and the creation of the county\\'s Citizens Emergency Response Teams. \\n \\nFormer colleagues described his absolute dedication and quiet, thoughtful leadership during chaotic events. \\n \\n\"He was at the helm when the county had some of its biggest weather events and tragedies,\" former county spokesman Ralph Shrom said. \"He was very calculating and very organized. He always had a handle on everything.\" \\n \\n\"The amount of work he was able to do was incredible,\" said Richard Dreby, the county\\'s former public safety director and Palmyra\\'s longtime fire chief. \"He was not only a tremendous asset to the county, but to all the local offices of emergency management. ... I think he was the best county coordinator in the entire state. He was that well respected.\" \\n \\nThe respect for Tuno extended beyond Burlington County, said Barry Eck, president of the New Jersey County Emergency Management Coordinators Association. \\n \\nThe organization named him New Jersey\\'s emergency management coordinator of the year in 2001 after the terrorist attacks. Tuno helped organize the county\\'s response to the attacks, which included sending volunteers and equipment to ground zero. \\n \\n\"He was a mentor and a trainer for so many people,\" Eck said. \"It\\'s a tremendous loss, not just for Burlington County but for everyone.\" \\n \\nThe ultimate test of Tuno\\'s leadership may have occurred on July 13, 2004, when a so-called \"1,000-year storm\" deluged parts of the county with up to 13 inches of rain in under 24 hours, bursting upstream dams along the Rancocas Creek and causing massive flooding in lakeside and downstream towns. More than 500 people had to be sheltered, and the estimated total damages in the county exceeded $50 million. \\n \\nTuno was never fazed, and never panicked, colleagues said. During events, he would ask various department heads and coordinators to report on what they were dealing with, and then coordinate the response. \\n \\n\"It was really well-organized. There wasn\\'t any screaming or demanding. If he told you something to do, you did it,\" Shrom said. \\n \\nAfter the storm, Tuno spearheaded the county\\'s efforts to help residents and local towns navigate the Federal Emergency Management Agency\\'s disaster relief programs. \\n \\n\"That\\'s no easy process. But (Tuno) really stepped up and assisted the communities get back to where they needed to be,\" Dreby said. \\n \\nFederal disasters were also declared after the Rancocas Creek flooded in 2007 and following Hurricane Irene in 2011, Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and earlier this year after a June 23 storm caused widespread damages in the\\xa0county. \\n \\nJoe Conlin, former Pemberton Borough police chief and director of public safety in Fieldsboro, has known Tuno for decades, since when they were firefighters in Burlington City and Burlington Township. \\n \\nHe said the loss of Tuno\\'s leadership was impossible to fathom. \\n \\n\"He was so good at what he did, and he did it for so long, you associated emergency management with Kevin completely,\" Conlin said. \\n \\nOther colleagues noted Tuno\\'s gentle manner and selflessness. \\n \\n\"Kevin was not only an unselfish hero, he was a gentle giant with a heart of gold and a kind word for everyone. He will be sadly missed,\" said a statement from the county Office of Emergency Management. \\n \\nCraig Augustoni, Pemberton Township\\'s longtime fire chief and emergency coordinator, said he\\'ll miss Tuno\\'s leadership and friendship. \\n \\n\"He was a top-notch guy who knew his job and did it well,\" Augustoni said. \"The county has lost a tremendous resource and an all-around good guy.

But weather scientists are recording water temperatures in the Pacific nearing the highest they\\'ve ever seen, suggesting El Niño will open an atmospheric fire hose in the jet stream this winter. That\\'s caused a rising tide of anxiety that has left even the highest-and-driest Californians on edge. \\n\\nAcross the Bay Area, roofers and tree-trimmers are so busy preparing for the onslaught that many have stopped accepting new jobs. And public works crews are shoring up creek beds, clearing storm drains and stocking up on sandbags in preparation.\\n\\nThe pre-El Niño buzz is already building along the banks of the San Francisquito Creek in below-sea-level East Palo Alto, and on rooftops from Alamo to Morgan Hill.\\n\\nAs the final nails were being driven into a new roof on Charles Hwuang\\'s Alamo home this week, he said he would sleep better this winter. \"Hearing about El Niño made me more nervous,\" Hwuang said, \"made me do something about it sooner rather than later. I\\'ll sleep better tonight.\" \\n\\nThe last \"very strong\" El Niño winter of 1997-98 left 17 Californians dead and property damage of $550 million in its wake. It also brought San Francisquito Creek, quite literally, to the Palo Alto doorstep of Kevin Fisher. His was one of 1,700 Peninsula properties damaged when the creek overtopped its banks after a month of steady rains. \"It was like being in an aquarium,\" Fisher said, recalling the water\\'s ominous rise outside a picture window facing his backyard.\\n\\nIf the rains come in quick succession, city storm drains in low-lying places like Pinole and Hercules in the East Bay can be counted on to back up and turn the streets into rivers.\\n\\n\"A few days of heavy rain, you\\'ll have flooding throughout the Bay Area,\" said Bill Allenbaugh, of El Sobrante, owner of Bill\\'s Defensive Driving School. \"That\\'s when it\\'s more likely there are going to be rear-end accidents with multiple vehicles involved. People just don\\'t pay attention. They drive at a certain speed, then it starts raining and they drive at the same speed. You can\\'t do that!\"\\n\\nThe roar of chain saws is likely to get louder this winter as PG&E crews respond to power outages caused by the drought-weakened timber. \"I think we\\'ve had 5,000 major trees die,\" said Gary Kremen, chairman of the board of the Santa Clara Valley Water District, which for months has been urging its customers to conserve water, and now must prepare to provide them with sandbags for flood control -- in a very real sense the sky is falling. \\n\\nEveryone wants this to be the deluge that douses the drought, but too much rain coming down too fast could sink low-lying communities like Alviso, East Palo Alto and Fisher\\'s neighborhood, which is a mile and a half southeast of San Francisquito Creek. \\n\\n\"Lives are at stake when it floods in East Palo Alto,\" Kremen said. \"In the 1998 flood, people almost died there. And it\\'s going to come. We will get some floods.\"\\n\\n\"What people don\\'t realize is that San Francisquito Creek drains 40 square miles of the Santa Cruz Mountains,\" says Fisher, an engineer, who had a narrow middle-of-the-night escape the last time, carrying his two small children, dog and elderly mother-in-law to a neighbor\\'s SUV after his family vehicles were flooded. \\n\\nThat night, the city of Palo Alto \"got caught totally flat-footed,\" Fisher said. \"They didn\\'t have a clue.\" Since then, an auto-dialer system to alert residents that the creek could flood has been installed, and a monitoring system allows anyone to watch the creek rise on their computer. \"But it\\'s been nearly 20 years,\" Fisher said, \"and truthfully, in terms of the flood risk, there\\'s been zero change. I think another flood would just about do us in.\"\\n\\nTo prevent anybody being done in by the next El Niño, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties created the Joint Powers Authority (JPA), which has taken a special interest in the Pope-Chaucer Street Bridge, a chokepoint on San Francisquito Creek that sits at the juncture of Palo Alto, Menlo Park and East Palo Alto. Crews were out last week shoring up the creek\\'s banks, and if the water gets dangerously high this winter, they will be back with sandbags and inflatable flood walls -- berms filled, perversely, with water.\\n\\nIn the heart of tech-savvy Silicon Valley, the preposterously low-tech burlap bag filled with sand remains the most sophisticated weapon to fight flooding. \"Short of actually building a big engineered solution,\" JPA Executive Director Len Materman said, \"sandbags are the tried-and-true solution.\"\\n\\nThe East Bay Municipal Utility District, which has no responsibility for flood control, maintains a stockpile of sandbags to prevent its water treatment plant from being flooded by an El Niño monsoon. \"There\\'s a lot of talk about what needs to be done this fall to be ready for it,\" Abby Figueroa, the district\\'s spokeswoman, said. \"It\\'s on everyone\\'s mind.\"\\n\\nOn an average day, the west Oakland water treatment plant gets about 60 million gallons of wastewater. During the sort of unhalting storms El Niño can bring, groundwater leaks into cracks in the sewer pipes and the volume of wastewater can triple, overwhelming the system and sensitive noses near the Bay Bridge. Figueroa said if the plant\\'s capacity remains maxed out for too long, it releases \"partially treated sewage\" into the bay.\\n\\nFour years of dry winters have lulled many homeowners into a false sense of security about the fitness of their roofs to withstand an El Niño pounding, said Jeff Tamayo, co-owner of Town & Country Roofing in Brentwood. His company would hire 25 additional workers if Tamayo could find them, which is why his crews are booked two months out.\\n\\n\"What happens historically is people wait for it to start raining before they call for a roof repair,\" he said. \"And by then it\\'s too late. We\\'ll be a month to six weeks out before we can get to them. With a heavy downpour and strong winds, things that should never, ever leak all of sudden leak very bad.\"\\n\\nOf course, there is no guarantee the coming storms will deliver the marauding moisture marinade that will recharge aquifers, refill reservoirs and leave a sable of snow in the Sierra to melt our troubles away. \"All the forecasts we\\'ve seen so far are about El Niño conditions. They\\'re not rainfall forecasts,\" meteorologist Jan Null, of Golden Gate Weather Services, said. \"We don\\'t know what we\\'re going to get.\"\\n\\nThe faster one storm is followed by another, the less water the ground can absorb, causing the kind of runoff that led to 33 landslides along Portola Valley\\'s Alpine Road during the \\'97-98 El Niño storms. Because Kevin Fisher lives in what the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated a floodplain, he is part of the tiny fraction of Californians who have flood insurance. About 8.3 million homeowner policies were in effect in 2011, according to the Association of California Insurance Companies, a private trade association, and yet as of this year only 232,651 of those included flood coverage. That\\'s 3.6 percent, compared to the 10 percent who carry earthquake insurance.\\n\\n\"Flood is not covered in a homeowners insurance policy,\" said Nicole Mahrt Ganley, the group\\'s spokeswoman. \"People talk about getting physically prepared for disaster, but they don\\'t always talk about being financially prepared. Even if you\\'re not required to have it, that doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s not a good idea.\" And flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period to take effect. \\n\\nAlong the bone-dry banks of the San Francisquito, you can almost hear the lyrics of the old Johnny Cash song, If the good Lord\\'s willing and the creeks don\\'t rise. Fisher doesn\\'t know the words, but he\\'s heard the tune before. \"Of course I\\'m worried,\" he said. \"We all are.\"\\n\\nContact Bruce Newman at 408-920-5004.

To honor National Preparedness Month, the chosen code was Code Blue Level 2 Medical Emergency, which indicates a “Life Threatening” medical emergency such as cardiac/respiratory arrest or seizure activity. \\n\\nAs part of their protocol in any code, certain steps must be taken to ensure safety. The staff at Brookhaven Retreat has been previously instructed and is therefore prepared in the knowledge that Code Blue always requires prompt and immediate attention. For instance, both the nurse on duty and the front office are to call 911. All nursing staff and physicians present will respond to the site to evaluate the situation and determine necessary actions to be taken.\\n\\nThe specifics of the procedure, as previously taught and published in the September newsletter, are as follows: \\n\\n1. Upon being informed of a “Code Blue Level 2” the nurse on duty will immediately call 911. \\n\\n2. Announce “Code Blue Level 2” clearly three (3) times on the overhead announcing system (850) and over the phones (851) giving the exact location. \\n\\n3. Respond to the location with the AED and the emergency cell phone. \\n\\n4. Institute emergency measures i.e.: CPR\\n\\nSince its inception in 2004, National Preparedness Month has been observed each September in the U.S. Sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland Security. This observance encourages people to prepare for emergencies in their homes, businesses, schools, and communities. FEMA's Ready Campaign, the correlating public education outreach campaign, disseminates information related to emergency situations including natural disasters and potential terrorist attacks. \\n\\nBeing prepared, no matter where you are, means having a plan in case unforeseen events present themselves. Remember to keep everyone in mind while making a plan, whether you are at home, at work, in the car or in a public place. Accidents can happen and we are better off and safer to have a plan than caught by surprise without knowledge of what to do and how to do it.\\n\\nLearn what to do in case of natural disasters, such as in a flood, hurricane, tornado, wild fire or winter storm on FEMA’s website, http://community.fema.gov/take-action/hazards, and be prepared to stay safe.\\n\\nAbout Brookhaven Retreat \\n\\nBrookhaven Retreat is a women's treatment center nestled on a naturally beautiful 48-acre site secluded in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. It has helped hundreds of women across the United States overcome depression, trauma, anxiety, substance use and a range of other behavioral health challenges. Brookhaven’s Founder, Jacqueline Dawes, has predicated its gender-specific treatment on “healing emotional breakage” for women. In this way, she has established a sanctuary and a place where women can feel safe, secure and cared for by a staff of highly trained professionals.\\n\\nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/brookhavenretreat/preparedness-month-2015/prweb12973369.htm\", 'source': '14 WFIE', 'title': 'Brookhaven Retreat Observes National Preparedness Month in September'}, '_index': 'news', '_type': 'sm'}, 'f902cfc4-6b8c-4ef0-b46e-e1ecf38eb6e8': {'_id': 'AVZ495QMO2kzNGWdnWhj', '_score': 0.90412647, '_source': {'media-type': 'News', 'id': 'f902cfc4-6b8c-4ef0-b46e-e1ecf38eb6e8', 'published': '2015-09-24T11:44:28Z', 'content': '(NAPSI)—Year after year, millions of Americans face danger from major storms, natural disasters and threatening power outages. The increasingly unpredictable nature of weather patterns, along with threats to our infrastructure provide a warning that major headaches can occur if homeowners postpone taking the steps necessary for proper preparedness. \\n  \\n“Proper preparedness is the best way to avoid potential harm to your home and your family,” said home improvement expert and Generac partner Danny Lipford, “Since September is National Preparedness Month, it’s an especially good time to create a disaster preparedness kit. I like to store mine in a laundry basket, so all of my items are organized in one place.” \\n \\nA disaster preparedness kit should contain the following items: \\n \\n• Fresh water and nonperishable food items—enough to last for about three days. \\n \\n• NOAA weather radio to stay on top of the storm, as well as any announcements from local authorities. \\n \\n• Flashlights and fresh batteries. \\n \\n• First-aid kit and any medications that you may need to last you for several days. \\n \\n• Emergency contact numbers such as police, fire, friends or family, so you can reach out to them in an emergency and let them know you are all right. \\n \\n• Any important documentation and identification that you don’t want lost. \\n \\n• Cash in case banks are not open or are not accessible. \\n \\nIt’s also important for homeowners to purchase a source of backup power, which can save Americans from scary situations that result from power loss. Being properly prepared for weather disasters and power outages can also save money. An outage can cost a homeowner thousands of dollars in lost food, travel expenses and even property damage—all of which can be avoided by investing now in preparedness items. Generac Power Systems offers a broad range of backup power solutions, from portable generators to automatic home backup power systems to commercial and industrial generators that, in the long term, could save millions and provide peace of mind. \\n \\n“Preparing for emergency situations only works if done in advance,” Lipford said. “Take time this month to really think about the potential dangers your family could face and get a kit and action plan prepared. Purchasing a source of backup power now, before disaster strikes, means your home and family will be protected during severe storms and extended power outages. National Preparedness Month reminds us the time to prepare is now, not during or after the threat when it’s too late.” \\n \\nFor more information on Generac and its product line, visit www.generac.com .

Hereford Inlet Light looks like an ordinary Victorian estate but what distinguishes it is its attractive tower, a tower that is 50 feet with a light, which makes it a lighthouse.  When Hereford Inlet Light was created in 1874 in North Wildwood , New Jersey  to help lead ships through the Hereford Inlet, Wildwood was called, “Anglesea,” it was a fishing town. \\n \\nPaul J. Pelz , who was a renowned German-American architect, who constructed the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., created Hereford Inlet Light in 1874.  Pelz, whose work won a prize for the Lighthouse Board at the 1873 Universal Exhibition in Vienna, made several lighthouses in the United States.  Pelz designed Point Fermin Light in San Pedro, California and East Brother Light in Richmond, California, two lighthouses that are known as Hereford Inlet’s sister stations, for they both have a similar Victorian design. \\n \\nIf there was a nickname to describe Hereford Inlet Light, it would be called, “Light of Steel,” for this beacon has survived so many disasters .  There was a storm in September 1889 that hit Hereford Inlet Light and this beacon remained intact.  In fact, residents of Anglesea used this lighthouse for shelter.  In August 1913, a fiercer storm brought the water very close to Hereford Inlet Light and destroyed the foundation of this beacon.  Hereford Inlet Light was saved and briefly closed; it was moved 150 ft. west to a safer location.  In 1914, this lighthouse was once again opened. \\n \\nHowever, these two storms were not the only hazards that Hereford Inlet Light would face.  In 1938, there was a fire at Hereford Inlet Light that occurred while Ferdinand Heinzman, the keeper of this structure, painted.  Heinzman, who was a brave and dedicated light keeper, extinguished the fire; a fire caused by spontaneous combustion, and saved the beacon that he loved so much. \\n \\nEver since 1977, Hereford Inlet Light is a National and State historic site .  Today this treasure of New Jersey still stands with the help of dedicated volunteers of the Hereford Inlet Lighthouse Commission.  This beacon still helps guide vessels.  Hereford Inlet Light is also a museum and a gift shop for tourists.

The information is based on satellite images and ground observations especially in remote areas of Colorado, like Grand County, the largest yellow spot on the map. \\n \\n“A lot of these areas where we’ve seen a lot of issues this year are in the forested mountainous areas. A lot of fire issues in Washington, Oregon and California. It’s not unusual,” he said. \\n \\nColorado continues to be the bright spot in the west , where much of the Pacific Northwest and especially California are in the worst drought seen in decades.\\xa0 \\n \\n“We haven’t seen a drought like this in California in 40 years. We’re living in a drought that would rival any in the last century plus another decade. Historically, you don’t see these kinds of droughts come around and then last for several years. That’s what makes it unique it’s not only the intensity, but also the duration,” Svoboda said.null \\n \\nUnlike other natural disasters, droughts can last for years causing billions of dollars in economic, social and environmental damage. \\n \\nWhy El Niño Won’t Fix the Drought \\n \\nWarmer oceanic sea surface temperatures, which characterize the natural phenomenon of El Niño , will release more moisture into the atmosphere, which rises into the jet stream and “is our conveyer belt of storm tracks and activity,” he said. \\n \\nForecasters expect a warmer winter in the central to northern Rockies and up into the Pacific Northwest, “so the drought could actually intensify up in the Pacific Northwest,” Svobota said. \\n \\nCalifornia remains the wild card. \\n \\n“Southern California certainly with the strong El Niño the odds are tilted in favor of being wetter, but that doesn’t mean that will push all the way up to the Sierra Nevada where we need big snows to fill in the reservoirs and streams.” \\n \\nBecause of the duration and severity of the drought, Svobota thinks it will take years of at least average snowpacks to bring the state back to a comfortable water storage position. \\n \\n“[It all depends on] where that [El Niño] pattern sets up. Where does it come on shore in California? And that remains to be seen.” \\n \\nClimatologists have forecast that the El Niño may stick around through spring of 2016. But the key is what form the moisture takes. \\n \\n“The perception is going to be El Niño is here, the drought is over,” Svobota said. “It takes more than that to recover. We want to see it in the form of snow, not rain. We want big snows that melt out slowly next summer that will help them sustain and start the recovery process. This winter is going to be really really critical.”', 'source': 'KUNC 91.5 FM', 'title': 'As The Parched West Looks To El Niño, Colorado Is Still The Wettest'}, '_index': 'news', '_type': 'sm'}, 'cf4469c8-7168-495f-afae-1fb120c4c33e': {'_id': 'AVZ49uqv3JDNhGBrUgJu', '_score': 0.64490473, '_source': {'media-type': 'News', 'id': 'cf4469c8-7168-495f-afae-1fb120c4c33e', 'published': '2015-09-16T00:10:54Z', 'content': 'By JENNIFER AMATO \\n \\nStaff Writer \\n   \\nPet owners should be proactive in protecting their pets before an emergency occurs by creating an action plan, preparing a to-go kit and visiting a new state website that provides tips about how to keep animals safe. FILE PHOTO Most residents know how to prepare for an emergency: have an escape route the entire family is aware of, keep supplies packed in an easily accessible backpack, make sure flashlights and radios have batteries. \\n \\nThe New Jersey Department of Agriculture has put forth a plan to protect animals as well in case of an emergency. \\n \\nA recently launched website at www.animalemergency.nj.gov , is designed to provide members of the public with up-to-theminute information they would need to protect their pets and livestock in times of emergency via computer, smart phones or mobile tablet devices. \\n \\nThe website comes just in time for hurricane season; also, September is National Disaster Preparedness Month. \\n \\nPet owners should prepare a general emergency kit that includes gauze pads, antiseptic wipes, hydrogen peroxide, scissors, tweezers, a blanket, food and water in case a situation such as a hurricane or fire occurs. FILE PHOTO “New Jersey has faced many emergencies, both large and small, in the last several years, and we know that people feel very strongly about protecting their animals in those situations,” New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H. Fisher said. “Our new website gives folks the resources they need to care for their animals in those trying times and also keep themselves safe in the process.” \\n \\nThe site is interactive, allowing people to simply type in their location to find the nearest help available, including animal shelters, veterinary hospitals, emergency management offices, feed stores, county fairgrounds and Rutgers Cooperative Extension offices. \\n \\nIn the event of an emergency, a “ticker” will be visible on the home page displaying real-time messages. “We learned a lot from past disasters, such as superstorm Sandy, and we know that preparing ahead of time for such events will make things easier not only for animal owners but also first-responders,” said Dr. Manoel Tamassia, New Jersey state veterinarian. “We ask that everyone spread the word and bookmark this site on your home computers, tablets and smart phones.” \\n \\nThe website will also include information about each county’s County Animal Response Team (CART). \\n  \\nVolunteers with Middlesex CART assisted in caring for dogs and cats during Hurricane Irene in 2011, superstorm Sandy in 2012 and the massive warehouse fire in North Brunswick in July, according to the Middlesex County Department of Public Safety and Health, among other emergency situations. \\n \\n“We know people’s pets are important to them,” said Middlesex County Freeholder H. James Polos, chairman of the county’s Public Safety and Health Committee. “Offering shelters to which people can bring their beloved pets gives them a sense of comfort in a time of chaos.” \\n \\nAs long as the pets are vaccinated and are not aggressive or sick, they can remain under the care of veterinarians, animal control officers, veterinary technicians and other animal professionals such as trainers or groomers for as long as the shelter is open, according to the department. \\n \\nSince CART is a bureau under the county’s Office of Emergency Management, it can be deployed immediately regardless of the American Red Cross, officials said. \\n \\n“Our residents’ safety and well-being is paramount in any emergency situation,” Middlesex County Freeholder Director Ronald G. Rios said. “Knowing that they can bring their pets with them will alleviate some anxiety and may allow people to evacuate to a shelter more quickly.” \\n \\nCART is also prepared to respond to other emergencies besides sheltering, such as assisting with hoarding situations, animal rescues, transportation accidents involving animals, etc. \\n \\nAnother resource available to the technologically savvy is the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals’ (ASPCA) mobile app to help pet owners be prepared. \\n \\nWith a few swipes, the user can access critical advice on what to do with pets before, during and after a major storm, receive a personalized pet recovery kit, build a lost pet digital flier that can be shared instantly on social media and receive the latest news on animal welfare. \\n \\nThe app is available in the App Store and Google Play. \\n \\nHowever, prior to needing emergency resources, humans can protect their canine and feline counterparts by taking precautionary measures. \\n \\nDiana Sichta, secretary of the North Brunswick Humane Association, suggested that pet owners pack a pet first aid and emergency kit, have emergency phone numbers handy, have their pet microchipped and take a pet first aid class. \\n \\n“Keep a detailed account of your pet. A pet journal that includes vaccines, emergency numbers, medications, etc., is a good way to ensure proper care of your pet with or without you. Make sure you keep it in an accessible place, in case you need it fast,” she said. \\n \\n“Take a picture of you with your pet in case you are separated. You might need it for ID when visiting or for the return of your pet. \\n \\n“Prepare for an emergency before any emergency by deciding where, when and what you will need before you need to do it.” she said. \\n \\nMichael Azzarello, a credentialed veterinary technician and instructor of the Veterinary Assistant Program at Brookdale \\n \\nCommunity College, Lincroft, said pets are susceptible to broken nails, cut paw pads, foreign body obstruction, bloat, heat-related emergencies and poisoning. \\n \\nGeneral emergency kits should include gauze pads, adhesive tape, antiseptic wipes, hydrogen peroxide, an ice pack, disposable gloves, a rectal thermometer, scissors, tweezers, towels, a pillowcase, a blanket and a pet carrier, in addition to food and water. \\n \\n“If owners are aware of an impending natural disaster, [they] should already have a pre-plan established on what they will do if they have to evacuate their residence. Locations that take pets, such as hotels, should already be included in your first aid kits. \\n \\n“You should check your feed supply and make sure you have an ample amount to get your pets through the disaster and at least one week after. Many stores aren’t going to be open after a major disaster, and finding your pets’ food could be tough. You don’t want to cause more health issues by changing your dog’s food drastically and making them vomit or have diarrhea,” said Azzarello, who is also the owner of Life Training Associates of Old Bridge. \\n \\n“Once the emergency is under control, an owner should restock the emergency kit, follow and complete their veterinarian’s recommendations, and learn from what had happened.” \\n \\nIt is also imperative for the pet owner to stay calm during an emergency situation. \\n \\n“Although it is very hard to understand what our animals are thinking … my thoughts would be an animal’s biggest issue during an emergency is fear. They also can sense our feelings much better than we think. The more excited a person gets, the more stressed our pets could become. \\n \\n“In addition, our normal, kind, loving pet could become aggressive during an emergency or, even worse, bite you or someone else that is trying to help. You should attempt to muzzle your pet during trauma or injury when attempting to give first aid. … If we think for a second about our animals’ ancestors, for instance the wolf, instinctively animals that are hurt are easy prey for a bigger predator. So, of course our pets are going to be scared when they are injured,” he said. \\n \\nIn order to minimize the stress of an emergency situation, Azzarello insisted that planning ahead is key. \\n \\n“You don’t want to put yourself at risk trying to make last-minute arrangements or having to go out and get pet items because you didn’t plan ahead. Remember, in the end, you can’t help your pet if you get hurt or worse,” he said. \\n \\nFor more information, visit the website at www.thedailymews.com/lifestyle/feline-fitness/pet-first-aid . aspcapro.org/sites/default/files/ready_pets_brochure.pdf or www.fema.gov/news-release/2011/12/01/disaster-plan-your-pets .', 'source': 'East Brunswick Sentinel', 'title': 'Protecting pets when disaster strikes'}, '_index': 'news', '_type': 'sm'}, '717602d5-cc67-4189-b1af-8a0a1e9092c7': {'_id': 'AVZ49sHJ3JDNhGBrUa85', '_score': 0.56463027, '_source': {'media-type': 'News', 'id': '717602d5-cc67-4189-b1af-8a0a1e9092c7', 'published': '2015-09-02T05:00:00Z', 'content': 'Health care facilities managers must consider a number of     factors when it comes to installing and using emergency power     generators. When hospitals cannot maintain power, they place     the lives of patients, employees and visitors at     risk.\\xa0Loss of communication is another concern, as is loss     of key data. In addition, the impact of major weather events,     such as Hurricane Katrina, has shined a spotlight on a complex     situation. \\n \\nMoreover, as the health care industry moves to a hub-and-spoke     model to provide more localized care, there is an increasing     need for backup power at off-site facilities, thus ensuring     that critical procedures are not interrupted in the event of a     utility outage. \\n \\nGovernment regulations are in place to make sure that off-site     facilities have emergency power-generation equipment available,     be it on a smaller scale. “Ambulatory surgery centers are     required by local and state codes to have emergency     power,” says Dan Chisholm Sr., president and emergency     power\\xa0consultant/designer, MGI Consulting Inc., Winter     Park, Fla. The same National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)     110 standards apply to these locations as for a Level I trauma     center. Emergency power must be available within 10 seconds to     Life Safety and Critical Branch loads if a utility failure     occurs. These same standards apply to some limited care and     long-term care facilities. \\n Location, location, location  \\nGenerators, switchgear and fuel systems should only be     installed in hospital locations where they are protected from     inclement weather, floods, earthquakes and fire, according to     Chisholm. “This requirement rules out most basement and     rooftop placements. Also, administrators must decide what     services they are required to provide per agreements with other     hospitals, state and local municipalities and for how long, in     the case of an extended utility outage. \\n \\n“This could dictate the type of fueling system options     (natural gas, diesel or a combination of both) and tight     compliance with EPA Tier 4 regulations on the latest diesel     engine designs. Contrary to popular belief, the newer natural     gas- and propane-powered sets can be used on selected projects     in several states.” \\n \\nHealth & Human Services has released a report on     “Hospital Emergency Preparedness & Response During     Superstorm Sandy” that urges hospitals to collaborate     with others. “The experiences of hospitals during     Superstorm Sandy and the deficiencies cited prior to the storm     reveal gaps in emergency planning and execution that might be     applicable to hospitals nationwide. Insufficient communitywide     coordination among affected entities was a common thread     through the challenges identified by hospital     administrators,” the report states. \\n \\nIn the report, HHS recommends that the Office of the Assistant     Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) continue to     promote federal, state and community collaboration during major     disasters. The agency also recommends that the Centers for     Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) examine existing     policies and provide guidance regarding flexibility for     reimbursement under disaster conditions. ASPR and CMS concurred     with those recommendations. \\n \\nHospitals typically require multiple generators because of     their size and the importance of power to overall operations.     “As a result, paralleling switchgear is important to meet     their sequence of operation. Switchgear — tailored to     specific needs — provides hospitals with the ability to     control power for their existing load while ensuring that     they’re covered for unforeseen events,” says     Michael Bosela, senior field applications\\xa0engineer, Kohler     Power Systems, Kohler, Wis. \\n \\nA key paragraph in NFPA 110 requires that hospitals restore     power to essential life safety loads in 10 seconds or less. In     California, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and     Development (OSHPD) requires seismic testing of generator     equipment on a shake table to replicate an actual event.     “Although the governance of OSHPD is in California, an     increasing number of outstate health care facilities are     including this requirement for their generator sets and other     power system equipment,” says Luke Dewey,\\xa0marketing     manager, Cummins Power Generation, Fridley, Minn. \\n \\n“Also, hospitals typically are located in high-population     areas and residential zones. These communities are expected to     demand more stringent sound-level requirements from the     generator-set equipment over time,” Dewey adds. \\n Technical advances  \\nGovernmental regulations are intertwined with new developments     in generator technology, according to manufacturers that supply     the nation’s hospitals. “As EPA emissions     requirements have evolved since 2006, advanced fuel delivery     systems had to be engineered into engines to meet these exhaust     requirements. Now technology has worked its way back onto the     generator itself,” says Daniel Barbersek, director of     industrial sales, Generac Industrial Power, Waukesha, Wis. One     example, he says, is the ability to record and report generator     operations. \\n \\nAnother technological advance is the ability to parallel with     other generators, which is done to promote both redundancy and     generator capacity. “The ability to control paralleling     units right at the generator, instead of using paralleling     switchgear, increases reliability by narrowing things down to a     single point of failure. Cost always has been a major hurdle     when using switchgear, as each section of paralleling gear can     cost as much as $60,000,” Barbersek says. \\n \\nMost technological advances in generator engine and alternator     design during the past 10 years involve controls, according to     Brian Ponstein, regional sales engineer, MTU Onsite Energy     Corp., Mankato, Minn. “The monitoring and controlling     features of generators have allowed operators to understand and     do much more with their units. The controllers also have     increased the capability of onboard paralleling features to     reduce the need for expensive switchgear.” \\n \\nMTU has incorporated low-load operation mitigation and better     fuel economy into its latest generators. This allows the     systems to run longer and hold up to the varying loads a     typical emergency power system experiences. “MTU achieves     better fuel economy by optimizing in-cylinder technology and     utilizing a high-pressure, common rail fuel system,”     Ponstein notes. \\n \\nCummins Power Generation offers a range of generators for     hospital applications that meet EPA Tier 4 final emissions     requirements through a combination of in-cylinder and exhaust     after-treatment technologies. This is EPA’s most     stringent emissions requirement for stationary generator sets,     the company reports. \\n \\nThe latest generator-set controllers from Kohler Power Systems     are robust, intuitive and easy to use, according to Bosela.     “We offer generator-set controllers to parallel and load     manage different types of fuel systems. For example,     paralleling a 500-kilowatt (kW) diesel generator with a 200-kW     natural gas generator is a relatively simple process. Our     customers also have the ability to add different size generator     sets to expand their system as their facilities grow.” \\n \\nDuring the past 10 years, technological advances that have     delivered the greatest gains in reliability relate to testing     and services that ensure that the complete electrical system is     healthy, according to Brian George, corporate account manager     for data center and health care markets, Caterpillar, electric     power division, Peoria, Ill. Examples include load bank     testing, megohmmeter testing that provides an accurate     conditional analysis of the alternator or transfer switch, as     well as fuel and starting battery testing and monitoring. \\n \\nCaterpillar is focused on providing sustainable solutions     beyond emergency diesel backup, George adds. “Our natural     gas generator-set product lineup offers high efficiency up to 4     MW [megawatts], which plays well into load management and     cogeneration applications. Cogeneration can provide system     efficiencies in the 85 to 90 percent range. \\n \\n“We see more demand from hospitals for integrated     emergency power systems from a single supplier —     everything from the generator set to the paralleling     switchgear/controls/automatic transfer switch to the     uninterruptible power supply. We also see more interest in     natural gas solutions for load management and cogeneration,     which leverages waste heat from the generator-set package for     facility heating or the production of chilled water,”     George notes. \\n \\nMore dual-fuel generator units, which run on diesel fuel and     natural gas, are being used in hospitals, experts agree. The     big attraction of this technology is extended run times. The     health care facility is able to enjoy the benefits that an     endless fuel supply of natural gas brings without exposure to     disruption that a utility connection brings. “This     approach also gives facilities managers the ability to maintain     a smaller amount of on-site diesel fuel,” says Barbersek. \\n \\nDual-fuel sets actually can double the time a hospital stays on     emergency power, experts agree. Also, if a natural gas     connection is shut off, the generator can still run on full     diesel, which makes for a win-win situation. \\n \\nConnecting nonessential loads such as HVAC and lighting to the     essential emergency power distribution system has been an     ongoing trend in the health care industry. The National     Electrical Code has allowed nonessential loads to be serviced     by the emergency power system for years. However, there is     ongoing discussion to determine which loads should be served by     the emergency systems, experts agree. In fact, the new trend is     to review what loads need to be served by emergency systems     during an extended outage.\\xa0Many loads once considered     nonessential for short-term outages now are being re-evaluated     as to the criticality of the function. \\n Looking ahead  \\nManufacturers see additional technological advances in the near     future. Better reporting and self-analysis when it comes to     trouble shooting is on a fast track as well as mean time     between repairs, according to Barbersek. “There also is     discussion on participating in utility load-curtailment     programs; however, emissions requirements continue to be a     major barrier,” he says. \\n \\nOver the short term, developments in technology will continue     to minimize generator emissions while making the units easier     to operate and manage, according to Bosela. “You can     expect generator manufacturers to further enhance their     controllers to offer a new level of intelligence that will     integrate seamlessly into building automation systems.” \\n \\nDewey expects to see increased remote monitoring of equipment     in an effort to optimize maintenance of the power system.     “Advances in remote monitoring will allow users and     technicians to respond more quickly to equipment issues and     provide maintenance based on actual usage of the     equipment,” he notes. \\n \\nGeorge sees growing interest in natural gas generation for load     management and cogeneration. “As distributed generation     — energy generated at the point of consumption —     grows as a percentage of overall U.S. capacity, health care     facilities will be a natural fit for leveraging gas     generator-set technology to better manage electricity, heating     and cooling costs. Condition monitoring and maintenance of     these emergency/load management power systems will be a     critical element in lowering costs and increasing     reliability.” \\n \\nChisholm sums up: “The bottom line is that emergency     power must be available 24/7, at any time the utility suffers a     failure, and it must be available to life-supporting loads     within 10 seconds for as long as the utility outage     lasts.”\\xa0 \\n \\nNeal Lorenzi is a freelance writer based in     Mundelein, Ill. \\n   Ready for action  \\nFour Series 4000 generator sets, each producing 2,250 kW, and paralleling switchgear offer emergency standby power to Nemours Children’s Hospital in Orlando, Fla. \\n \\nMTU Onsite Energy Corp. \\n    Two to one  \\nTwo generator sets, two controls and one automatic transfer switch illustrate the manufacturer’s Power of One offerings. \\n \\nCummins Power Generation \\n    Sound system  \\nEdward Hospital in Naperville, Ill., uses two Cat 3516 diesel generator sets with a dual-silencer system and paralleling switchgear to meet power generation and sound requirements. \\n \\nCaterpillar \\n    Future functions  \\nOngoing advancements on generators such \\nas this 600-kW model will minimize emissions while making the units easier to operate and manage. \\n \\nKohler Power Systems', 'source': 'Health Facilities Management', 'title': 'Critical features of emergency power generators'}, '_index': 'news', '_type': 'sm'}, 'b0118d01c1de480297ad3b5f315d0ee92aa85c94': {'_id': 'AVaFQQ8Ry1kBQQb2GPB7', '_score': 0.8344128, '_source': {'media-type': 'News', 'published': '2013-02-09T23:17:00Z', 'id': 'b0118d01c1de480297ad3b5f315d0ee92aa85c94', 'source': 'reuters', 'title': 'Blizzard hammers U.S. Northeast, five dead, 700,000 lose power', 'content': 'Natural Disasters »\\nBOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A record-breaking blizzard packing hurricane-force winds hammered the northeastern United States on Saturday, cutting power to 700,000 homes and businesses, shutting down travel and leaving at least five people dead.\\nThe mammoth storm that stretched from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic dumped more than 3 feet of snow across the Northeast, the National Weather Service said.\\nCoastal blizzard and flood warnings were in effect, but Massachusetts and Connecticut lifted vehicle travel bans as the storm slowly moved eastward on Saturday afternoon.\\nStratford, Connecticut, Mayor John Harkins said he had never seen such a heavy snowfall, with rates reaching 6 inches an hour.\\n\"Even the plows are getting stuck,\" Harkins told local WTNH television.\\nThe storm centered its fury on Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, with the highest snowfall total, 38 inches, in Milford, Connecticut.\\nAbout 2,200 flights were canceled on Saturday, according to FlightAware, which tracks airline delays.

By August, an inferno was stirring in the forests east of the Cascades. A wind-whipped blaze near the mountain town of Twisp, Washington — a \"hell storm,\" to quote a local sheriff — claimed the lives of three Forest Service fire scouts. That blaze soon exploded into the worst wildfire in state history, charring more than 300,000 acres and destroying dozens of homes. \\n Sidebar    Apocalypse Soon: 9 Terrifying Signs of Environmental Doom »  \\nAs they raged, the wildfires in eastern Oregon and Washington devoured an area nearly the size of Delaware. The states called up more than 1,000 members of their National Guards, and the Army mobilized 200 active-duty troops to the fire lines. Ten Blackhawk helicopters and four C-130 Hercules aircraft deployed to help fight fire from the skies. With Gov. Jay Inslee calling the blazes an \"unprecedented cataclysm,\" Washington even deputized citizen volunteers to fight the fires, where they joined professional crews from as far away as Australia and New Zealand. \\n \\nThis is the present, and the future, of climate change. Our overheated world is amplifying drought and making megafire commonplace. This is happening even in the soggy Pacific Northwest, which has been hard-hit by what\\'s been dubbed a \"wet drought.\" Despite near-normal precipitation, warm winter temperatures brought rain instead of snow to the region\\'s mountains. What little snow did hit the ground then melted early, leaving the Northwest dry — and ready to burn in the heat of summer. \\n \\nThe national data is as clear as it is troubling: \"Climate change has led to fire seasons that are now on average 78 days longer than in 1970,\" according to a Forest Service report published in August. In the past three decades, the annual area claimed by fire has doubled, and the agency\\'s scientists predict that fires will likely \"double again by midcentury.\" \\n Sidebar    How Climate Change May Alter Forests Worldwide »  \\nThe human imprint on the bone-dry conditions that lead to fire is real — and now measurable. According to a major new study by scientists at Columbia and NASA, man-made warming is increasing atmospheric evaporation — drawing water out of Western soil, shrubs and trees. In California alone, the epic drought is up to 25 percent more severe than it would have been, absent climate change. And this impact doesn\\'t respect state borders. The study\\'s lead author, Columbia scientist Park Williams, tells Rolling Stone , \"There\\'s the same effect in the Pacific Northwest.\" \\n \\nStanding near fire lines in late August, Inslee vowed to extinguish the blazes in his state. But the governor also called on Americans to confront an enemy fiercer and more insidious than fire itself. He declared, \"We\\'ve got to attack this at its source: carbon pollution.\" \\n \\nT he fiery future is upon us. Pervasive drought and record temperatures — July was the warmest month ever physically recorded on planet Earth — have turned forests from Fresno to Fairbanks into tinderboxes. In Alaska, more than 5 million acres burned — surpassing the 10-year average for the entire country. With months left in the fire season, the blazes of 2015 have already scorched more than 8 million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center — a record pace, likely to top the 9.8 million acres that burned in 2006. \"Some of these fires that are in these forested areas could burn until it snows,\" said NIFC spokeswoman Jessica Gardetto. \\n \\nSteep reductions in greenhouse pollution can lessen the danger going forward, as Inslee suggests. But the dark reality is that significant future burning has already been locked in. In parts of the West, very large fires will increase sixfold by midcentury, according to a new study from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. With our nation\\'s firefighting resources tapped out by the fires of the present, America finds itself woefully unprepared for the blazes to come, much less the worst-case scenario: a Katrina by fire. \\n \\nFor a glimpse of the future, look north, to Alaska and the Arctic — which President Obama, during a visit to Anchorage this summer, highlighted as \"the leading edge of climate change.\" Soaring temperatures and an early-melting snowpack have brought raging wildfires to landscapes that have not been kissed by flame for millennia. \"Climate change is no longer some far-off problem,\" Obama declared. \"It is happening here. It is happening now.\" \\n \\nThe world is warming most toward the poles, and temperatures in Alaska have been increasing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the country in the past 60 years — up almost three degrees. And the state\\'s average fire season has increased by more than a month — 35 days — since the 1950s. \"We can detect the climate-change influence on fire,\" says Glenn Juday, a forest ecologist at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, who points to three indicators all on the upswing: \"the area burned, the severity of the burning and then the frequency.\"\\xa0 \\n Winds blew acrid smoke from Western fires as far as Atlanta, creating hazardous air quality. John Grimwade  \\nThe tragedy of climate-driven megafire is that the fires themselves worsen global warming by pumping megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is especially true north of the Arctic Circle. For the past 5,000 years, the Arctic Alaskan tundra was too frigid and too wet to support significant wildfire. That changed in 2007, when a massive blaze ripped through Alaska\\'s North Slope. The fire burned more than 400 square miles, not only charring a pristine landscape, but setting off a greenhouse bomb, igniting organic matter in the soil that had lain dormant for centuries. This single fire released as much carbon dioxide into the air as the Arctic\\'s entire tundra ecosystem, including the northern reaches of Canada and Russia, had absorbed in the previous quarter century. Scientists long considered the tundra the \"most secure storehouse of carbon — fixed carbon, keeping it out of the atmosphere — that you could possibly think of,\" says Juday. \"It was frozen — and a thick mat of it. We never thought a big chunk of it would burn. It\\'s astounding.\" What\\'s worse: Tundra fire also thins the soil layer that insulates permafrost, further destabilizing this terrifying reserve of greenhouse gases. \\n \\nThis summer, Alaska was set to burn due to an unusually warm winter combined with a pitiful snowfall. (Anchorage recorded barely two feet of snow — shattering a record that had held up for 60 years.) With spring came soaring temperatures: more than seven degrees above average statewide. The city of Eagle, Alaska, 200 miles east of Fairbanks, hit 91 degrees in May — a higher temperature than had been recorded to that date in either Houston or Dallas. \\n \\nWhen lightning struck, Alaska blazed. \"At one point this summer,\" Obama noted, \"more than 300 wildfires were burning at once.\" Blazing largely out of control, the fires consumed 5.1 million acres — the second-worst fire season on record. As bad as wildfire has been in Alaska, it will only get worse, according to the National Climate Assessment, the 2014 federal report that gauges regional risks of climate change. Assume everything goes right at climate talks this year in Paris; assume world governments leap to action with aggressive measures to curb carbon emissions — even under this scenario, according to the report, Alaska wildfire will double by 2050 and triple by 2100. \\n \\nA s worldwide temperatures rise, wildfires will only increase. But what is less intuitive is how a dangerous drought and fire season have gripped the Pacific Northwest — despite annual precipitation levels that were close to normal. The problem, it turns out, was not a lack of water, but rather that so little of it fell as snow. \\n \\nUnder typical conditions, deep mountain snowpacks and late spring stream runoff give protection from wildfire by keeping trees and vegetation moist far into summers that can run hot and dry — particularly east of the Cascade Mountains. This winter, temperatures soared 5.6 degrees above normal in the region, leading to record-low snowpack, and to stream runoff that peaked, in many places, in the dead of February. In March, Inslee declared a statewide drought emergency in Washington. By June, the snowpack was just\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009gone. \\n \\n\"This drought is unlike any we\\'ve ever experienced,\" Maia Bellon, the director of Washington state\\'s Department of Ecology, said in May. It has primed the region to burn. Susan Prichard, a fire ecologist at the University of Washington, says the sudden drying of overgrown forests created a \"perfect storm\" for big fires in eastern Oregon and Washington. \"It leads us,\" she says, \"to a tinderbox situation.\" \\n \\nThe warming air is sucking the forests dry — literally. Man-made higher temperatures increase the atmosphere\\'s appetite for moisture; Williams, the Columbia climate scientist, jokes that the effect is like a Mafia shakedown, with the air constantly demanding more water from the land. In wet years, the atmosphere\\'s increased thirst doesn\\'t matter much. But in times of drought, this tax on the water system is significant and damaging. \"That cost is now becoming large enough that it\\'s really detectable,\" Williams says, \"and it\\'s reducing water availability for humans and ecosystems.\" \\n \\nJoe Casola, deputy director of the Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington, points to the future. This year\\'s combination of warm winter, low snowpack, early runoff, hot summer and fire is straight from the textbook — \"a good preview,\" he says, of what climate models tell us will soon be commonplace. \"These are the conditions we\\'re likely to be facing several decades from now and going forward.\"\\xa0 \\n A detailed look at the 2015 fire season – one of the worst on record. John Grimwade  \\nAccording to current EPA projections, April snowpack in the Cascades will shrink by as much as 40 percent by 2040. \"Higher summer temperatures, earlier spring snow melt and potential reductions in summer soil moisture would contribute to wildfire risk,\" the agency concludes. \\n \\nBy 2080, according to the National Climate Assessment, the median acreage burned in Pacific Northwest wildfires is likely to quadruple. So what does that mean on the ground? Instead of a once-in-20-years event, the type of megafires now ravaging Oregon and Washington could be expected to occur one year out of every two. \\n \\nI f fire is inevitable, there\\'s a glint of good news: America can get much smarter about how it fights wildfire, by making simple changes to the funding of the Forest Service. \"We all agree that the way wildfire management has been funded is broken,\" Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said in August. \"It is past time that we fix it.\" \\n \\nWith surprising ease, you can track climate change in the portion of the Forest Service budget that\\'s spent fighting fire. In 1995, it was only 16 percent. This year — for the first time ever — more than 50 percent of the budget will go to firefighting. Ten years from now, the agency projects, these costs will balloon to become two-thirds of the budget. \\n \\nThe situation has become so dire that the Forest Service now robs its fire-prevention budget — money for clearing brush, thinning forests and conducting \"prescribed burns\" that help prevent future megablazes — just to fund its firefighting. The exploding cost of combating fire is \"crippling\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009the very programs and restoration projects that reduce the fire threat,\" the agency reports. \\n \\nIn its wisdom, Congress has set the Forest Service budget on the basis of a 10-year average cost. That formula worked well enough with a more stable climate. But the agency has been saddled with ever-increasing, and increasingly costly, megafire. \"The six worst fire seasons since 1960,\" the agency reported in August, \"have all occurred since 2000.\" \\n \\nWith the Northwest ablaze, Congress is responding. The reform effort is championed by Western lawmakers, including, ironically, Republicans who have either denied climate change exists, like Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming, or fought controls on greenhouse gases, like Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. \\n \\nSimpson\\'s Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would decouple the agency\\'s budget from the cost of fighting megafires. Only one percent of blazes are now driving 30 percent of costs. Under Simpson\\'s plan, fighting megafires would instead be funded out of the $12 billion federal disaster relief fund — the same kitty that FEMA taps when it provides relief from hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. \\n \\nOregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, is insisting he\\'ll push the issue to the forefront when Congress reconvenes this month. \"My first order of business,\" he said, \"is to end the terrible trifecta that makes these fires worse: underfunding firefighting budgets, stealing money from fire prevention to make up the shortfall and letting hazardous fuels build up as a result.\" \\n \\nA s the nation reframes its thinking about wildfire — from the routine natural burns of 50 years ago to today\\'s climate-aggravated megablazes —\\xa0it is crucial not to overlook the worst-case scenario: a major metropolis engulfed in fire. \\n \\nAmerica has seen previews of this catastrophe: In 1991, a wildfire swept into the hills and canyons above Oakland, overwhelming firefighters, claiming 25 lives, injuring 150 other people and causing more than $1.5 billion in property damage. The 2003 Cedar Fire, driven by Southern California\\'s fierce Santa Ana winds, scorched more than 280,000 acres. The worst fire in the state record books, the October blaze reached into the suburbs of San Diego, burning more than 2,200 homes. Wildfire hit again in 2007, forcing thousands of residents to take refuge in Qualcomm Stadium, the venue where the NFL\\'s Chargers play. \\n \\nIn a small blessing, the record fire season in the Pacific Northwest this summer has been relatively limited in its human and financial costs. The affected region is sparsely populated forest and rangeland, separated from Seattle and Portland by a major mountain range. But the fires\\' secondary effects on these cities shouldn\\'t be discounted: In late August, shifting winds funneled dangerous smoke from multiple fires down through the Columbia Gorge, temporarily turning Portland into a smoke box. Particulate concentrations in the city\\'s air reached \"unhealthy\" levels usually not seen outside Beijing. \\n \\nBut in the big picture, America was lucky that wildfire hadn\\'t struck the parched hills of Silicon Valley, or swept down through Colorado\\'s Front Range into the suburbs west of Denver. Indeed, Northern California skirted disaster in July. The Rocky Fire — sparked by a decrepit water heater — threatened the city of Clear Lake, north of the state\\'s fabled Napa Valley, ripping through 70,000 acres, jumping a highway and subjecting 13,000 residents to evacuation orders. Ken Pimlott, the director of CAL Fire, the state\\'s fire authority, says California still faces \"unprecedented fire behavior and fuel conditions\" and that the worst of the fire season is likely \"yet to come\" in Southern California. \"We haven\\'t dodged a bullet by any stretch of the imagination,\" he says. \\n \\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown has recently been calling out the Republican presidential candidates who refuse to even acknowledge that climate change exists. \"Longer fire seasons, extreme weather and severe droughts aren\\'t on the horizon,\" he wrote in an open letter to GOP candidates. \"They\\'re all here — and here to stay.\" \\n \\nWith a lightning strike or an arsonist\\'s match, the fire next time could threaten San Jose, San Diego or the L.A. Basin — each a major engine of the national economy. At its most dangerous, warming-driven wildfire poses an existential threat. \"The climate is unstable,\" Brown told reporters in August. \"If the drought was to continue for a year or several years, California could literally burn up.\"', 'source': 'Rolling Stone', 'title': 'What Megablazes Tell Us About the Fiery Future of Climate Change 1 day ago'}, '_index': 'news', '_type': 'sm'}, 'f27337cd-a9b8-4ce4-b55a-247069253d68': {'_id': 'AVZ493ldy1kBQQb2F6fA', '_score': 0.8398715, '_source': {'media-type': 'News', 'id': 'f27337cd-a9b8-4ce4-b55a-247069253d68', 'published': '2015-09-08T21:20:00Z', 'content': \"Study: Are we shifting to fewer, weaker Atlantic hurricanes?

Here\\'s a summary of where things stand:\\n\\x95 Oklahoma officials have confirmed 24 deaths from the storm and 237 injuries. Nine children were among those killed, including seven who died at Plaza Towers elementary school. Moore Fire Chief Gary Bird, who has led the search and rescue effort, said Tuesday afternoon that the search effort was nearing completion and he was \"98% sure\" that no more survivors or bodies remain to be discovered.\\n\\x95 The national weather service changed its classification of the tornado that struck Monday to EF-5, the highest level, with wind speeds of over 200mph. The storm left a track 17 miles long and in places over a mile wide through the the communities of Newcastle and Moore. It destroyed two elementary schools, a hospital, gas stations, other businesses, parking lots full of vehicles and many square blocks of residences.\\n\\x95 With just more than 24 hours since the storm hit, the focus of recovery efforts began to shift from search and rescue to reopening roads, cleaning debris and ensuring that storm victims\\' basic needs are met. The community saw an outpouring of donations of food and water, shelter, medical services, transportation, pet care, and much more. Those in need of aid were asked to call (800) 621-FEMA. Donations can be made to the Red Cross . The state established an online resource for victims, families, volunteers and donors: www.ok.gov/okstrong/\\n\\x95 Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin that the state would rebuild. President Obama spoke with her on Tuesday after declaring a state of emergency on Monday. Fema director Craig Fugate was in Moore to direct the federal response. Fallin said the state was tapping \"rainy day\" money to fund emergency operations. House speaker John Boehner said Congress would work with the president to make sure the state had the help it needs.\\n\\x95 Neither of the elementary schools destroyed in the storm had a tornado \"safe room,\" officials said. Federal money had funded safe rooms at about 100 schools statewide, but neither Plaza Towers nor Briarwood school had applied through local channels for aid, the state director of emergency management said.\\n\\x95 It was the second time Moore has been hit by a top-level tornado in 14 years. On 3 May 1999 the area was hit by a tornado that killed 41.\\n5.02pm ET\\nPictures of Plaza Towers elementary school before and after being struck by the tornado, via local KFOR-TV.\\nBefore and after pic of Plaza Tower Elementary.Totally leveled. #mooretornado More pics: bit.ly/Zbwkm8 twitter.com/kfor/status/33\\x85\\nat 5.17pm ET\\n4.48pm ET\\nThe weather service uses the enhanced Fujita scale to measure the severity of a storm. Fema director Craig Fugate has developed a rougher gauge for disaster severity: the Waffle House index.\\nThe Guardian\\'s Ewen MacAskill explains :\\nCraig Fugate, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, came up with the idea of the \"Waffle House index\" as an informal way of measuring the impact of a disaster. The chain, which has a large number of branches in tornado-prone areas, has a robust emergency management plan.\\nThe index has three levels. If the local Waffle House is up and running, serving a full menu, a disaster is classed as green. If it is running with an emergency generator and serving only a limited menu, it is a yellow. If it is closed, badly damaged or totally destroyed, as during hurricane Katrina , it is a red.\\nThere is only one Waffle House in Moore, the suburb worst hit by the tornadoes. The restaurant, located at 316 SW 19th Street and which normally offers a southern-tinged menu that includes grits, hash browns, and sausage and egg biscuits as well as hamburgers, was closed on Tuesday.\\nBut the Moore tornado was classed as a yellow on the Waffle House index because managers were hoping to get it up and running soon.\\nRead the full piece here .\\n4.43pm ET\\nGuardian reader Tyler Davis (commenter SantoSubito ), one of the first readers to join our live coverage, has described his experience of the tornado to Kayla Epstein of the Guardian US social team.\\nDavis lives about ten miles south of Moore, in Norman, Oklahoma. We\\'ve edited his account for length and clarity:\\nMy family does not have a storm shelter and our plan is to hide in the closet under the stairs and cover ourselves with a mattress. Before the storm hit we lost power and we didn\\'t have a working radio apart from a Zune with an FM receiver. I heard on the radio about 10 minutes before the tornado hit that it was heading towards our area. I quickly tossed everything out of the closet and hurried the kids in and threw a mattress over them. We all just huddled in the closet with the dogs until I learned through the radio that the storm had missed us and hit Moore. My neighborhood is fine apart from some hail damage and a few broken tree limbs from the wind.\\nWhen we emerged, I went out on the front porch to see a constant stream of police and fire trucks streaming down the road and they were soon joined by National Guard Humvees. I haven\\'t been able to get close to the area to see what\\'s going on since the authorities have blocked the roads leading into the area.\\n(h/t @ katierogers )\\n4.29pm ET\\nThe Moore fire chief believes that all survivors and victims have been found in Moore, a CBS News affiliate reports:\\nFire Chief Gary Bird said that he\\'s \"98 percent sure\" there are no more survivors or bodies to recover under the rubble in Moore. #okwx\\n\\x97 News 9 (@NEWS9) May 21, 2013\\nAt a news conference three hours ago, Bird said rescue crews still had to make at least two passes through many damage areas, but he expected that work to be completed by nightfall.\\n4.21pm ET\\nA high-speed clip of satellite footage of Monday\\'s storm system taking shape over the Moore, Oklahoma area.\\n(h/t: @ mikeseidel )\\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration explains the source of the footage:\\nOn May 20, 2013 as conditions were ripening for severe weather outbreaks in the U.S. Plains, the NOAA Satellite and Information Service placed the GOES-13 satellite into rapid scan operations - meaning that the satellite went from taking imagery every 30 minutes to every 5 minutes.

Seven of those children died at Plaza Towers elementary school. Governor Mary Fallin said 237 people were injured in the storm. Rescue crews were still searching for survivors and the casualty numbers were expected to change.\\n\\x95 President Obama declared a state of emergency in the region Monday night, and Fema director Craig Fugate is in Moore to direct the federal response to the disaster. The Moore Fire Department is heading up the local search and rescue effort. An emergency crew of 200 rescuers worked through the night. Crews expected to have completed three passes through every disaster scene by nightfall.\\n\\x95 The Moore public schools superintendent said all area schools carried out emergency plans to shelter in place during the storm. A focus of rescue activity was at Plaza Towers school, which was flattened. The school lacked a \"safe room,\" officials said, as did neighboring Briarwood elementary, also destroyed. Although rescue efforts continue, officials were not aware of any missing students, and no survivors had been found at Plaza Towers school on Tuesday.\\n\\x95 The tornado left a track 17 miles long across Moore and the neighboring community of Newcastle. At points the track of the storm is said to be a mile wide. Winds from the storm reached 190mph, according to the national weather service.\\n\\x95 Volunteers from across the region converged on Moore to help with the rescue effort. Prodigious donations of water and food, shelter and services came in. Local water service was expected to return to full capacity by day\\'s end. An emergency insurance claims site was set up. Those in need of aid were asked to call (800) 621-FEMA.

After federal funds become available, local jurisdictions decide which schools should get a safe room, he says.\\n\"They weren\\'t applied for,\" for the two destroyed schools, he says. There is a \"limited amount of funds based on disasters in the past,\" Ashwood says.\\n\"We\\'re going to be looking at how to up that number, and how to get more safe rooms.\"\\n2.07pm ET\\nGovernor Fallin is taking questions. She recalls visiting the ruins of Plaza Elementary school Monday night:\\nTo know that we had children, and parents who had gone up to that school looking for their children... It was a very frightening time, and still is for those who don\\'t know yet, the outcome from someone who may still be missing.\\n2.04pm ET\\nOklahoma\\'s insurance commissioner, John Doak, speaks. He explains how residents can make insurance claims.\\nAn insurance command center has been set up at Moore Baptist Church at 301 NE 27th in Moore, Doak says.

The increasingly unpredictable nature of weather patterns, along with threats to our infrastructure provide a warning that major headaches can occur if homeowners postpone taking the steps necessary for proper preparedness. \\n  \\n“Proper preparedness is the best way to avoid potential harm to your home and your family,” said home improvement expert and Generac partner Danny Lipford, “Since September is National Preparedness Month, it’s an especially good time to create a disaster preparedness kit. I like to store mine in a laundry basket, so all of my items are organized in one place.” \\n \\nA disaster preparedness kit should contain the following items: \\n \\n• Fresh water and nonperishable food items—enough to last for about three days. \\n \\n• NOAA weather radio to stay on top of the storm, as well as any announcements from local authorities. \\n \\n• Flashlights and fresh batteries. \\n \\n• First-aid kit and any medications that you may need to last you for several days. \\n \\n• Emergency contact numbers such as police, fire, friends or family, so you can reach out to them in an emergency and let them know you are all right. \\n \\n• Any important documentation and identification that you don’t want lost. \\n \\n• Cash in case banks are not open or are not accessible. \\n \\nIt’s also important for homeowners to purchase a source of backup power, which can save Americans from scary situations that result from power loss. Being properly prepared for weather disasters and power outages can also save money. An outage can cost a homeowner thousands of dollars in lost food, travel expenses and even property damage—all of which can be avoided by investing now in preparedness items. Generac Power Systems offers a broad range of backup power solutions, from portable generators to automatic home backup power systems to commercial and industrial generators that, in the long term, could save millions and provide peace of mind. \\n \\n“Preparing for emergency situations only works if done in advance,” Lipford said. “Take time this month to really think about the potential dangers your family could face and get a kit and action plan prepared. Purchasing a source of backup power now, before disaster strikes, means your home and family will be protected during severe storms and extended power outages. National Preparedness Month reminds us the time to prepare is now, not during or after the threat when it’s too late.” \\n \\nFor more information on Generac and its product line, visit www.generac.com .

China\\'s full range of disaster response is on display: Trucks with x-ray equipment, phone-charging stations, bank tellers-on-wheels - even a tent for insurance claims.\\nThe efforts under way Monday in mountainous Sichuan province after a quake Saturday that killed at least 188 people showed that the government has continued to hone its disaster reaction - long considered a crucial leadership test in China - since a much more devastating earthquake in 2008, also in Sichuan, and another one in 2010 in the western region of Yushu.\\n\"Lushan was so heavily hit and my family\\'s house toppled. It has been such a disaster for us,\" said Yue Hejun, 28, as he waited to recharge his family\\'s three mobile phones at a charging stall, volunteered by a communications company and coordinated by the government in a new addition to the arsenal of services after natural disasters. \"If we can charge our phones, we are at least able to keep in touch with our family members outside and that helps to set our minds at ease.\"\\n(MORE: Interactive Map: Earthquake Location )\\nAt a mini-clinic with two green cots in the open air and a small tent for doctors to sleep, a doctor said the government has learned the importance of fast coordination since the Yushu quake, which killed more than 2,600 people. Much of the initial relief in that disaster came from Buddhist monks and other non-government volunteers, partly because of the remoteness of much of the affected areas.\\n\"After 24 hours or 48 hours in Yushu, things were not so orderly or settled in,\" said the doctor, who like many government officials would give only her surname, Luo. \"The government\\'s quick, organized response is very important. It\\'s no use to blindly come here and try to save people.\"\\nHelicopters have been an obvious presence in the latest rescue efforts, used to reach outlying communities, unlike in 2008 when bad weather hampered their use in the critical first 36 hours. This time, better use of helicopters for reconnaissance - with remote sensing technology - and for the distribution of aid has allowed help to get out more quickly to where it is needed, said Teng Wuxiao, director of the Institute of Urban Public Security at Fudan University in Shanghai.\\nStill, complaints were common among the survivors of the latest quake, especially in the more hard-to-reach areas. While aid was being delivered, it was not getting out to all who need it. Yue said family members in his remote mountain village had received no help with shelter and were living under tarpaulins.\\nHuang Mingxian, 47, who was camped out with seven family members in a government-issued blue tent in a small public square, said the government\\'s efforts were appreciated but that supplies were not always distributed fairly.\\n\"This morning is the first time in three days that we have gotten instant noodles,\" Huang said, waving a pair of long chopsticks she was using to stir the noodles in a wok over a gas canister-powered mobile stove. \"Other areas have electricity and water, what about us?\"\\nEarlier Monday, about two dozen residents briefly gathered on a street corner near a camp area, shouting that they had not been given food in two days. A half-hour later, a large truck rolled up and dozens of evacuees ran up to it, jostling as the supplies were being handed out.\\n(MORE: Stay Safe During, After an Earthquake )\\nThe death toll in Saturday\\'s quake - measured at magnitude 7.0 by Chinese authorities and at magnitude 6.6 by monitors in the U.S. - may continue to tick upward, with about two dozen people still missing. More than 15,000 people have been sent to hospitals, with more than 300 of them seriously injured.\\nCentral authorities\\' ability to respond to natural disasters has been seen as tests of legitimacy for centuries. Chinese emperors put state resources into controlling floods, and earthquakes and other disasters were believed to be signs that a dynasty was losing the \"mandate of heaven.\"\\nThe state-run tabloid Global Times boasted in an editorial of China\\'s communal \\'disaster-relief\" culture, and its \"more mature\" response to the latest quake, comparing it favorably to those overseas. \"In its ability to mobilize people and in other indicators, China\\'s disaster relief comes ahead of the United States, Japan and other developed countries,\" the newspaper said.\\nThe Foreign Ministry said that Beijing is turning away foreign offers of assistance, saying China is capable of handling it on its own.\\nIn Lushan county\\'s town, where many of the buildings are unsafe for use, the grounds of schools, hospitals, a gymnasium and other government buildings have been converted into evacuee camps. Quake survivors formed long lines in front of trucks and stalls to receive instant noodles, bottled water and other supplies.\\nBeyond the bare necessities, there are also stalls for survivors to make insurance claims, a large vehicle that converts into a bank and ATM-on-wheels, and tents sponsored by Chinese telecoms companies providing numerous electrical extension cords for residents to recharge their electrical gadgets.\\nHigh school seniors in the disaster area will be moved this week to the provincial capital, Chengdu, along with 30 teachers so that they can continue classes and take the all-important university entrance exam, the state Xinhua News Agency reported.\\nAs typically happens after disasters, Chinese with cars were packing them with supplies and heading to the disaster area. Anticipating traffic congestion that could hamper emergency teams, the government issued a notice Monday asking volunteers, tourists and others not trained as rescuers to stay out of the disaster area.\\nHowever, authorities were letting motorcyclists through.\\nPeng Song, 28, an outdoor equipment retailer who biked to Lushan from the provincial capital of Chengdu, had his motorcycle packed with tents and bottled water and was riding with 14 other bikers-turned-volunteers out to remote communities.\\n\"Those in the disaster area need help. We just want to offer a hand to them, that\\'s all,\" Peng said.\\n1 / 19\\nChina Earthquake\\nAssociated Press\\nVillagers gather for a meal outdoor in the quake struck Lushan county in southwestern China\\'s Sichuan province on April 22.

September 03, 2015) - RealtyTrac ® ( www.realtytrac.com ), the nation\\'s leading source for comprehensive housing data, today released its 2015 U.S. Natural Disaster Housing Risk Report, which found that 35.8 million U.S. single family homes and condos with a combined estimated market value of $6.6 trillion are in counties with high or very high natural hazard risk. Those 35.8 million homes represent 43 percent of the 83.4 million single family homes and condos in all counties analyzed for the report. \\n\\nFor the report RealtyTrac assigned a natural disaster risk score to 2,318 counties nationwide with sufficient home value data available. Based on its score, each county was assigned to one of five risk categories for overall risk of natural disaster: Very High, High, Moderate, Low and Very Low. Similar scoring and ranking was also used to rate risk for each of the five natural disasters individually (see full methodology below). \\n\\n\"In the interest of personal safety and protecting the value of what is likely their biggest financial asset, prospective buyers and investors should be aware of any natural disaster risk impacting a potential home purchase,\" said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. \"There is no reason homebuyers need to be surprised with natural disaster risk information when wading through a stack of disclosures at the closing table given the widespread availability of this data online and even through mobile apps. \\n\\n\"In most cases learning about natural disaster risk will not stop a home sale, but it will help buyers make a better-informed decision about where to buy and also be prepared in terms of appropriate insurance coverage and family contingency plans depending on the type of natural disaster risks most affecting the home they end up purchasing,\" Blomquist added. \\n\\nStates with the most homes in High risk or Very High risk counties for overall natural disaster risk are California (8.4 million), Florida (6.7 million), New York (2.4 million), New Jersey (2.3 million) and North Carolina (2.3 million). \\n\\nMetro areas with the most homes in High risk or Very High risk counties for overall natural disaster risk are New York (3.5 million), Los Angeles (2.5 million), Miami (1.9 million), Houston (1.2 million), and Riverside-San Bernardino in Southern California (1.1 million). \\n\\n\"The weather is beautiful in SoCal, but we are statistically more susceptible to the risk of fire, floods and earthquakes than most areas. Our agents must be articulate in explaining the higher risks to buyers. People have to be able trust their agent to fully disclose the risks of natural disasters and homeownership to allow buyers to make the most informed decisions,\" said Mark Hughes, chief operating officer with First Team Real Estate , covering the Southern California market. \"A well-informed knowledgeable buyer is best prepared to take on the potential risks associated with SoCal homeownership.\" \\n\\n29 Percent of Homes Worth an Estimated $4.7 Trillion in Counties with High Hurricane Risk \\nThe report found that 24.5 million single family homes and condos (29 percent of the 83.4 million total) with a combined estimated market value of $4.7 trillion are in counties with a High risk or Very High risk for hurricanes. \\n\\nStates with the most homes in High risk or Very High risk counties for hurricanes are Florida (6.7 million), North Carolina (2.4 million), Virginia (2.0 million), New York (1.9 million) and New Jersey (1.8 million). \\n\\nMetro areas with the most homes in High risk or Very high risk counties for hurricanes are New York (3.0 million), Miami (1.9 million), Washington, D.C. (1.8 million), Boston (1.1 million) and Tampa (953,000). \\n\\n\"The allure of South Florida\\'s sun and surf, for most, outweigh any concern of a hurricane threat,\" said Mike Pappas, CEO and president of the Keyes Company covering the South Florida market. \"The improved communication, continual education and enhanced predictability all give comfort to our coastal residents. History has shown that we are not only able to survive but in fact thrive with insurance and property improvements after a storm hits.\" \\n\\n13 Percent of Homes Worth an Estimated $1.8 Trillion in Counties with High Wildfire Risk \\nThe report found that 10.6 million single family homes and condos (13 percent of the 83.4 million total) with a combined estimated market value of $1.8 trillion are in counties with a High Risk or Very High risk for wildfires. \\n\\nStates with the most homes in High risk or Very High risk counties for wildfires are California (1.9 million), New York (1.6 million), Florida (1.6 million), North Carolina (1.1 million), and New Jersey (1.1 million). \\n\\nMetro areas with the most homes in High risk or Very High risk counties for wildfires are New York (2.1 million), Riverside-San Bernardino in Southern California (1.1 million), Charlotte, North Carolina (471,905), Columbia, South Carolina (252,155), and Charleston, South Carolina (214,666). \\n\\nHome Values Higher in High Risk Areas, 10-Year Price Growth Stronger in Low Risk Areas \\nHomes in Very High risk counties for overall natural disaster risk had an average estimated market value of $170,237, and homes in High risk counties had an average estimated market value of $191,244. Meanwhile the average home value in Very Low risk counties was $151,793, and the average home value in Low risk counties was $154,464. \\n\\nAlthough average home values were higher in higher-risk counties, home price appreciation over the past 10 years was stronger in lower-risk counties. Among 551 counties with sufficient historical home price data, home sales prices in counties with a Low risk for natural disasters increased 6.6 percent on average between 2005 and 2015, and home sales prices in counties with a Very Low risk for natural disasters rose 9.5 percent on average during the same time period. \\n\\nConversely, home sales prices in counties with a High risk for natural disasters decreased 2.5 percent on average over the past 10 years while home sales prices in counties with a Very High risk for natural disasters decreased 6.4 percent on average. \\n\\n\"Each year we experience damaging storms and it is with anticipation we recommend buyers make sure they have adequate insurance to protect them from carrying the burden of replacing a roof when the storms hit,\" said Heidi Greer, owner/broker at RE/MAX Alliance , covering the Denver market in Colorado, which was one of six states with no counties rated High or Very High for overall natural disaster risk despite having some counties rated as High risk for wildfires and floods. \"Our mountain areas have a much higher risk of fire and there are regulations buyers must be made aware of when they purchase wooded properties or have the intent of adding structures in wooded locations. Buyers who prefer the mountain areas are normally aware of the added risk before they consider moving there.\" \\n\\nHome price appreciation over the past three years has been stronger in higher risk counties for natural disaster. In counties with a High risk for overall natural disaster, home prices increased 16.6 percent between 2012 and 2015 on average, while home prices in counties with a Very High risk for natural disasters increased 20.4 percent during the same time period. Home prices in Low risk counties increased an average of 10.1 percent over the past three years, and home prices in Very Low risk counties increased an average of 12.8 percent during the same time period. \\n\\n\"Across Ohio, amenities abound to assist in the mitigation of potential risk of natural hazards,\" said Michael Mahon, president at HER Realtors , covering the Cincinnati, Dayton and Columbus markets in Ohio, where just one county was rated High for overall natural disaster risk despite the state having the seventh highest number of homes in counties rated High risk for tornados. \"Given the risk of tornadoes some homebuyers are only interested in seeing homes with basements to mitigate the risk.\" \\n\\nReport methodology \\nIn its second annual U.S. Natural Disaster Housing Risk Report, RealtyTrac analyzed five different natural disasters posing a risk to housing: earthquake risk, hurricane risk, tornado risk, flood risk and wildfire risk. Based on these five factors, each of the counties analyzed was assigned a combined natural disaster risk score from 0 to 300, with 300 representing the most risk (190 was the highest score among all the counties). Based on these scores, counties were assigned one of five different categories of risk of natural disaster: Very High Risk (Score of 90 or higher); High Risk (55 to 89 score); Moderate Risk (30 to 54 score); Low (15 to 29 score); and Very Low (0 to 14 score). \\n\\nDetailed methodology for each individual natural disaster risk \\nThe earthquake risk score is based on a predictive earthquake risk model created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that calculates the probability of a 5.0 magnitude earthquake occurring within a 30-mile radius over the next 50 years. \\n\\nThe hurricane risk score is based on historical hurricane activity data from 2001 to 2013 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that ranks hurricane risk in each county on a scale from 0 to 456,668. \\n\\nThe tornado risk score is also derived from NOAA data from 2001 to 2013 that provides a Destruction Potential Index (DPI) for each county based on the number of tornados, path area of tornados in square miles and intensity of tornados using the Fujita scale of F0 to F5. \\n\\nThe flood risk score is based on flood zones defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. For this report, RealtyTrac analyzed the percentage of single family homes in each county that are in flood zones considered high risk by FEMA (A, A99, AE, AH, AO, V, and VE). \\n\\nThe wildfire risk is based on categories of Wildfire Disaster Potential (WHP) developed by the USDA Forest Service and Fire Modeling Institute. For this report, RealtyTrac analyzed the percentage of property parcels that are in areas defined as having \"Very High\" or \"High\" WHP. \\n\\nThe 551 counties analyzed for 10-year and three-year home price appreciation only included counties with at least 10,000 single family homes and condos and excluded counties where historic home price data was insufficient. \\n\\nAbout RealtyTrac \\nRealtyTrac is a leading provider of comprehensive U.S. housing and property data, including nationwide parcel-level records for more than 130 million U.S. properties.

Bus service was free but delayed, and New Yorkers jammed on, crowding buses so heavily that they skipped stops and rolled past hordes of waiting passengers.\\nNew York City buses serve 2.3 million people on an average day, and two days after the storm they were trying to handle many of the 5.5 million daily subway riders, too.\\nAs far west as Wisconsin and south to the Carolinas, more than 6 million homes and businesses were still without power, including about 650,000 in New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.\\nThe mayor said 500 patients were being evacuated from Bellevue Hospital because of storm damage. The hospital has run on generators since the storm. About 300 patients were evacuated from another Manhattan hospital Monday after it lost generator power.\\nBloomberg also cancelled school the rest of the week, and the Brooklyn Nets, who just moved from New Jersey, scratched their home opener against the Knicks on Thursday.\\nStill, there were signs that New York was flickering back to life and wasn\\'t as isolated as it was a day earlier.\\nFlights resumed at Kennedy and Newark airports on what authorities described as a very limited schedule. Nothing was taking off or landing at LaGuardia, which suffered far worse damage. Amtrak said trains will start running in and out of New York again on Friday.\\nThe stock exchange, operating on backup generators, came back to life after its first two-day weather shutdown since the blizzard of 1888.

He visited the state in late summer to draw attention to the looming climate catastrophe the world faces, but with the exception of one big policy speech when he sounded as apocalyptic as any hemp-growing activist, he spent most of his three days up north beaming. \"He\\'s happy to be out of his cage,\" one aide joked. Others credited the buoyant U.S. economy or the fact that the president had just learned that he had secured enough votes to protect the hard-fought nuclear deal with Iran from being derailed by Senate Republicans. \\n Sidebar    The Point of No Return: Climate Change Nightmares Are Here »  \\nWhatever the reason, you could see the cheerfulness in his face the moment he stepped out of his armored presidential limo at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage, where the air was hazy with smoke from the wildfires that had burned millions of acres in Alaska. The president was all smiles, shaking hands with local pols and then bounding up the stairs into Air Force One. No suit and tie, no sir — today, on what was the third and final day of his trip, he was dressed for adventure in black outdoor pants, a gray pullover and a black Carhartt jacket. \\n \\nHe was heading north to Kotzebue, a village about 30 miles above the Arctic Circle, which is suffering from a climate-disaster trifecta of melting permafrost, rising seas and bigger storm surges. As White House press releases and video blogs pointed out, this was a historic trip — not only would Obama be the first sitting president to ever visit the Arctic, but he would also be the first president to use a selfie stick to take videos of himself talking about the end of human civilization. \\n \\nThe president\\'s upbeat mood was an odd and unexpected counterpoint to the seriousness and urgency of the message he was trying to deliver. \"Climate change is no longer some far-off problem; it is happening here, it is happening now,\" Obama said in his remarks to an international conference on the Arctic in Anchorage on the first day of his trip. In perhaps the starkest language he has ever used in public, Obama warned that unless more was done to reduce carbon pollution, \"we will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair: submerged countries, abandoned cities, fields no longer growing.\" His impatience was obvious: \"We\\'re not moving fast enough,\" he repeated four times in a 24-minute speech (an aide later told me this repetition was ad-libbed). \\n \\nObama\\'s trip to Alaska marked the beginning of what may be the last big push of his presidency — to build momentum for a meaningful deal at the international climate talks in Paris later this year. \"The president is entirely focused on this goal,\" one of his aides told me in Alaska. For Obama, who has secured his legacy on his two top priorities, health care and the economy, as well as on important issues like gay marriage and immigration, a breakthrough in Paris would be a sweet final victory before his presidency drowns in the noise of the 2016 election. \"If you think about who has been in the forefront of pushing global climate action forward, nobody is in Obama\\'s league,\" says John Podesta, a former special adviser to Obama who is now chairing Hil-lary Clinton\\'s presidential campaign. (One recent visitor to the Oval Office recalled Obama saying, \"I\\'m dragging the world behind me to Paris.\") \\n \\nPolicywise, the president didn\\'t have much to offer in Alaska. He restored the original Alaska Native name to the highest mountain in North America (Denali), accelerated the construction of a new U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker, doled out a few million bucks to help Alaska Native villages move to higher ground — largely symbolic gestures that didn\\'t do much to help Alaskans deal with the fact that their state is melting like a popsicle on a summer sidewalk. In the end, the trip was mostly a calculated and well-crafted presidential publicity stunt. And it raised the question: If the American people see the president of the United States standing atop a melting glacier and telling them the world is in trouble, will they care? \\n \\n\"Part of the reason why I wanted to take this trip was to start making it a little more visceral and to highlight for people that this is not a distant problem that we can keep putting off,\" the president told me. \"This is something that we have to tackle right now.\" \\n \\nObama could not have picked a better place to make his point than Alaska. Climatewise, it is the dark heart of the fossil-fuel beast. On one hand, temperatures in the state are rising twice as fast as the national average, and glaciers are retreating so quickly that even the pilot of my Delta flight into Anchorage told passengers to \"look out the window at the glaciers on the left side of the aircraft — they won\\'t be there for long!\" The very week of Obama\\'s visit, 35,000 walruses huddled on the beach in northern Alaska because the sea ice they used as resting spots while hunting had melted away; in the Gulf of Alaska, scientists were tracking the effects of a zone of anomalously warm water that stretches down to Baja California and which has been named, appropriately enough, \"the blob.\" On the other hand, the state is almost entirely dependent on revenues from fossil-fuel production, which, thanks to the low price of oil and exhausted oil and gas wells on the North Slope, are in free fall — the state is grappling with a $3.7 billion budget shortage this year. Alaska Gov. Bill Walker had flown from Washington, D.C., to Anchorage with the president at the beginning of his trip; according to one of the president\\'s aides, Walker asked the president to open more federal lands to oil and gas drilling to boost state revenues. \"Alaska is a banana republic,\" says Bob Shavelson, executive director of Cook Inletkeeper, an environmental group in Alaska. \"The state has to pump oil or die.\"\\xa0 \\n President Obama shooting his selfie video about the end of human civilization. Pete Souza/White House  \\nWhen it comes to climate change, the rap on Obama has always been that he\\'s better at talk than action. He campaigned in 2008 on a promise to cut carbon pollution and push cap-and-trade legislation through Congress, but his commitment lacked urgency. (During the 2008 campaign, he went out of his way to support \"clean coal,\" which was the favorite buzzword of Big Coal and political shorthand for \"Don\\'t worry, Midwestern voters, I\\'m not really serious about this climate-change stuff.\") The year he took office, he brokered a last-minute deal at the Copenhagen climate negotiations, but decided to make health care reform, not climate legislation, his top priority in the first term. With the economy faltering, he pushed through an $800 billion stimulus bill that jump-started the clean-tech revolution in America, financing investment in wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. And he used the leverage he gained during the federal bailout of the auto industry to double fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles. But after the 2010 midterm elections, the president had to deal with a Republican Congress full of rabid climate deniers. Rather than confront them and use his bully pulpit to build political momentum for action on climate change, he essentially went dark on the issue for the rest of his first term.\\xa0 \\n \\nThat changed in the second term. \"I think his 2013 inaugural address was a turning point,\" says the president\\'s senior adviser Brian Deese. \"He wrote it more or less himself, without policy people, and it really marks a change in his thinking.\" In that address, Obama makes the case for immediate action: \"We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.\" \\n \\nAnd he made good on that. In June 2013, he unveiled a detailed 75-point Climate Action Plan, which essentially redirected the entire federal government to begin taking climate change seriously. With the help of Podesta, whom he brought in as a senior adviser in early 2014, Obama launched a series of executive actions that circumvented Congress but still allowed him to demonstrate that he was serious about cutting America\\'s carbon pollution. Just as important, he cut a deal with China to reduce carbon pollution in both countries, which broke the logjam on international politics and removed one of the major talking points against taking stronger action on climate change (\"China isn\\'t doing anything, so why should we?\"). Finally, earlier this year he introduced the Clean Power Plan, which will use the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s regulatory authority to cut power-plant CO 2 emissions by 32 percent by 2030.\\xa0 \\n President Obama at the Dillingham Airport. Pete Souza/White House  \\nNearly all of Obama\\'s policies have focused on reducing demand for fossil fuels; when it comes to shutting down supply, he has been far less ambitious. He has expanded drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, allowed fracking for natural gas, sold coal leases in Wyoming at flea-market prices and still has not officially killed the controversial Keystone pipeline. This reflects a seemingly deliberate philosophy that reducing demand is a more effective way to wean our economy off fossil fuels than shutting off supplies — which, in a global market, will just be provided elsewhere. Just a month before the trip began, the Department of the Interior approved a permit to allow Shell to perform exploratory drilling this summer about 75 miles off the coast of Alaska in the Chukchi Sea. White House officials argued that approving the dril-ling was hardly a sign that the president was unserious about climate change and pointed out, accurately, that the lease had been sold years earlier by the Bush administration, that there are already some 30 exploratory wells drilled in the Arctic, that the Department of the Interior had only approved this one after pushing hard for new safety regulations and environmental protections, and that, even if all went well, Shell wouldn\\'t begin pumping oil for at least a decade. Nevertheless, climate activists blasted the president for hypocrisy; Al Gore called Arctic drilling \"insane.\" \\n \\nFor the flight up to Kotzebue, the Air Force left the president\\'s 747 parked on the tarmac in Anchorage and switched to a smaller plane, a 757 (it was also dubbed Air Force One, which applies to any aircraft the president is flying in — his staff called it \"mini-Air Force One\"). Several members of Obama\\'s senior staff were along, including Deese and Susan Rice, his national-security adviser. \\n Sidebar    Obama and the Road Ahead: The Rolling Stone Interview »  \\nRice\\'s presence on the trip was a reminder that a rapidly melting Arctic also has rapidly escalating national-security implications. As the ice vanishes, a whole new ocean is opening up — and one that contains 30 percent of the known natural-gas reserves and 13 percent of the oil. Unlike Russia, the U.S. is poorly equipped to operate up there, with only two icebreakers (the Russians have 40). And the Russians aren\\'t the only ones with eyes on the Arctic — as we were flying toward Kotzebue, five Chinese warships were cruising in international waters below. Coincidence or power play? And off to the east, the Canadian military had just wrapped up Operation Nanook, an annual large-scale military exercise, which, according to the Canadian government, was \"to assert sovereignty over its northernmost regions.\" \\n \\nBefore we crossed into the Arctic, we touched down in Dillingham, a small town on Bristol Bay that is the heart of the salmon fishery in Alaska. The presidential motorcade headed straight for the beach, where a couple of Alaska Native women had caught silver salmon in a net, which made another nice visual tableaux for the president\\'s social-media feed and gave him a chance to talk briefly about the importance of salmon in Alaska\\'s economy. (However, he managed to avoid addressing the Pebble mine, a massive and controversial gold and copper mine that is seeking permits in Alaska courts and that, if built, would destroy the headwaters of the salmon fishery.) The funniest moment of the entire trip occurred when the president, who was wearing orange rubber gloves, held up a two-foot-long silver salmon that a fisherwoman had given him. The salmon, apparently a male and still very much alive, ejaculated on his shoes. Obama laughed, and the fisherwoman said something privately to him. The president laughed again and repeated her remark loud enough for everyone to hear: \"She says he\\'s happy to see me.\"\\xa0 \\n The view from Air Force One of Kivalina Island. Pete Souza/White House  \\nNext stop, Kotzebue. On the way, the president decided to circle over the island of Kivalina to have a look at it. Kivalina is the poster child for the havoc that climate change is wreaking on Alaska Native villages along the coast, where the thawing permafrost is destabilizing the soil, causing houses to collapse and allowing the rising sea to wash the island away. About 400 people live on Kivalina, and their way of life is doomed — relocating the village to higher ground on the mainland will cost an estimated $100 million, which, so far, neither the state nor the federal government has been willing to pay for. And Kivalina is just one of a dozen or so communities that are at immediate risk on the Alaska coast. \\n \\nWe touched down in Kotzebue (population 3,200) at about 5 p.m. The president was greeted on the tarmac by Reggie Joule, the mayor of the Northwest Arctic Borough, then we climbed into our assigned vehicles in the motorcade for the short drive to the high school. We rolled by flimsy weather-beaten houses with American flags hanging in the windows and broken dog sleds in the front yards. You could sense the hardship of life in a place where it gets down to 100 degrees below zero (including wind chill) in the long, dark winters and where the nearest road to civilization is 450 miles away. About 170 miles to the west, across the Bering Strait, is Russia. \\n \\nThe motorcade pulled up at Kotzebue High School, a large metal building draped with banners welcoming the president and snipers pacing on the roof. A thousand people crowded into the gym, draped with the blue and gold colors of the Kotzebue Huskies. Obama gave a relaxed speech about climate change and the wonders of the far north, clearly enjoying the fact that history would remember him as the first sitting president to visit the Arctic. He said he was envious that Warren Harding spent two weeks in Alaska during a trip in 1923, but then explained that he had to get back quickly because \"I can\\'t leave Congress alone that long.\" \\n \\nWhen it was over, a White House aide guided me into a nearly empty classroom with a large round table in the center and two blue plastic chairs. Ice crystals made from blue construction paper hung from the ceiling, and a Secret Service officer kept watch by the door. Then the president walked in. We shook hands, exchanged a few words about the flight, then Obama sat down in one of the plastic chairs and said, \"Let\\'s do it.\" We talked for more than an hour — the cheerfulness that had animated many of his public remarks on this trip dissipated. He spoke in measured tones, but with a seriousness that suggested that he believed — not unjustifiably — that the fate of human civilization was in his hands. Only near the end, when I asked if he felt any sadness about what we are losing in the world as a result of our rapidly changing climate, did he show any emotion — he averted his eyes for a moment and looked away, as if the knowledge of what\\'s coming in the next few decades was almost too much to bear. \\n \\nSo let\\'s start at the beginning. In 2008, on the day you received the nomination for president, you said, \"I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.\" It\\'s been seven years now. How do you feel about the progress you\\'ve made? \\nWell, I\\'ll leave it to others to give a report card on myself. I\\'ll say that, collectively, we have made modest progress, but nowhere near what we need to do. \\n \\nIn the United States, we had an early defeat when we couldn\\'t get congressional passage of a cap-and-trade bill. And we saw Republicans who, in some cases, had previously supported cap-and-trade suddenly run the other way. And so we had to find another way to skin the cat. \\n \\nAnd we started with the clean-energy investments that we made early on through the Recovery Act, the work that was done in conjunction with the automakers — in part, frankly, because we were helping them out a lot during that phase — to double fuel-efficiency standards and to look at what we could do administratively in terms of regulatory standards that would create greater efficiency. \\n \\nAnd Copenhagen, although it was a disorganized mess — and I still remember flying in that last day, and nothing was happening, and I literally had to rescue the entire enterprise by crashing a meeting of the BRIC countries [Brazil, Russia, India and China] and strong-arming them into coming up with at least a document that could build some consensus going into the future. \\n \\nWhat we were able to do was to establish the basic principle that it wasn\\'t going to be enough just for the advanced countries to act — that China, India, others, despite having much lower per-capita carbon footprints, given the sheer size of their populations and how rapidly they were developing, were going to have to put some skin in the game as well. \\n \\nSo where does that leave us now? We set a 17 percent target [for emissions reduction]; we are on track to meet that. We have doubled our production of clean energy — wind-energy production up threefold, solar up twentyfold. We\\'ve been able to grow the economy from the depths of the recession while emitting less carbon than we did. Our auto and truck regulations are on track. And the prospect of a real clean-energy economy is there on the horizon. It\\'s achievable. And as I\\'ve said, we\\'ve been able to do that while creating millions of jobs and dropping the unemployment rate down. And none of the disasters that were predicted from our regulatory steps have taken place.\\xa0 \\n President Obama briefs foreign leaders at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Pete Souza/White House  \\nWith the clean-power-plant rule, we are now doubling down. And I think it\\'s fair to say that with the steps we\\'ve taken through the clean-power-plant rule to reduce carbon emissions from the single largest source by over 30 percent, we\\'ve been able to establish a very aggressive target of 26 to 28 percent carbon reduction. Probably as importantly, we\\'ve been able to lead by example in a way that allowed me to leverage China and President Xi to make their own commitments for the first time, to have a conversation with somebody like Prime Minister Modi of India or President Rousseff of Brazil, so that they put forward plans.\\xa0 \\n \\nAnd I believe that when we get to Paris at the end of this year, we\\'re now in a position for the first time to have all countries recognize their responsibilities to tackle the problem, and to have a meaningful set of targets as well as the financing required to help poor countries adapt. And if we\\'re able to do that by the end of this year — and I\\'m cautiously optimistic — then we will at least have put together the framework, the architecture to move in concert over the next decade in a serious way. \\n \\nBut having said all that, the science keeps on telling us we\\'re just not acting fast enough. My attitude, though, is that if we get the structure right, then we can turn the dials as there\\'s additional public education, not just in the United States but across the world, and people feel a greater urgency about it and there\\'s more political will to act. \\n \\nHere in Alaska, you talked in almost apocalyptic terms about the future we face if we don\\'t cut carbon pollution quickly. But at the same time, you recently approved a new round of drilling in the Arctic here. How do you justify that decision? \\nThis has been an ongoing conversation that I\\'ve had with the environmental community. One of the things about being president is you\\'re never starting from scratch, you\\'ve got all these legacies that you wrestle with. And obviously, the fossil-fuel economy is deeply entrenched in the structure of everybody\\'s lives around the world. And so from the start, I\\'ve always talked about a transition that is not going to happen overnight. \\n \\nAnd regardless of how urgent I think the science is, if I howl at the moon without being able to build a political consensus behind me, it\\'s not going to get done. And in fact, we end up potentially marginalizing supporters or people who recognize there\\'s a need to act but also have some real interests at stake. \\n Sidebar    Obama and Climate Change: The Real Story »   \\nAlaska, I think, is a fascinating example of that. We\\'ve been having conversations with Alaska Natives who are seeing their way of life impacted adversely because of climate change, but also have a real interest in generating jobs and economic development in depressed areas. And so they\\'ll talk to me about climate change and in the same breath say, \"By the way, we really are looking to use our natural resources in a way that can spur on economic development.\" And that\\'s just a microcosm of what\\'s true across America and what\\'s true around the world. \\n \\nSo my strategy has been to use every lever that we have available to move the clean-energy agenda forward faster, which then reduces the costs of transition for everybody — in fact, in many cases, saves people money and saves businesses money — so that we\\'re reducing what is perceived as a contradiction between economic development and saving the planet. \\n \\nAnd when it comes to our own fossil-fuel production, what I\\'ve said is there\\'re some things we\\'re just not going to do, not only because it\\'s bad for the climate, but it\\'s also bad for the environment or too risky — Bristol Bay, where we went to earlier today, being a prime example where we just took out the possibility of oil and gas drilling around the Aleutians in ways that would threaten Bristol Bay. Same thing up north. \\n \\nBut to say that, knowing there\\'s still going to be some energy production taking place, let\\'s find those areas that are going to be least likely to disturb precious ecosystems, and let\\'s raise the standards — meaning making them more costly — but not shut them off completely, and that allows me then to have a conversation not with folks who are climate deniers, and not with folks who are adamant about their right to drill, explore and extract anywhere, anytime, but with those folks who are of two minds about the issue. \\n \\nAnd I think that process is something that we have to take into account even when something is really important. Even when something threatens us all, we have to bring everybody along. We had the same discussion around something like fracking. The science tells us that if done properly, fracking risks can be minimized. And natural gas is a fossil fuel, but the reason we\\'re not seeing coal-fired plants being built in the United States is not just because of the clean-power-plant rule — because we just put that in place. The reason is it wasn\\'t economical because natural gas was so cheap. And we have to make those choices.\\xa0 \\n President Obama visits Kanakanak Beach. Pete Souza/White House  \\nNuclear energy — we approved a nuclear plant down South. And there are some environmentalists who don\\'t like that either. But while acknowledging the risks that we saw in Fukushima, we also have to acknowledge that if we\\'re going to solve climate change, energy is going to have to come from somewhere for a lot of these countries. \\n \\nSo there\\'s always this balance. And I see this even in other issues. When I came into office, I was clear about wanting to end \"don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell.\" A lot of people said, \"Well, why not just end it right away?\" And I took two years to build a consensus within the Pentagon so that by the time we actually ended it, it was something that had the support of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and that made it a lot easier to get done. \\n \\nThe problem, of course, is that building consensus on climate change is different than other issues because you have physics to account for too, right? The warming of the planet is not waiting for consensus-building. \\nI understand. But if we\\'re going to get our arms around this problem, which I think we can, then we are going to have to take into account the fact that the average American right now, even if they\\'ve gotten past climate denial, is still much more concerned about gas prices, getting back and forth from work, than they are about the climate changing. And if we are not strategic about how we talk about the issue and work with all the various stakeholders on this issue, then what will happen is that this will be demagogued and we will find ourselves in a place where we actually have slower progress rather than faster progress. \\n \\nSo the science doesn\\'t change. The urgency doesn\\'t change. But part of my job is to figure out what\\'s my fastest way to get from point A to point B — what\\'s the best way for us to get to a point where we\\'ve got a clean-energy economy. And somebody who is not involved in politics may say, \"Well, the shortest line between two points is just a straight line; let\\'s just go straight to it.\" Well, unfortunately, in a democracy, I may have to zig and zag occasionally, and take into account very real concerns and interests. \\n \\nI think one of the failures that we had in the cap-and-trade legislation that came up early in my first term was we were doing so many things at that time. People\\'s minds were overwhelmingly focused on economic recovery and getting people back to work — and rightly so — that for a member of Congress who might care about climate change, but was seeing massive job loss, and comes from an industrial state where the [cost of] transition is going to be really high to go from dirty energy to clean energy — casting a vote like that just didn\\'t seem to be a priority. And we hadn\\'t built enough of the consensus that was required to get that done. \\n \\nDo you have any regrets about how you handled that cap-and-trade legislation in your first term? It passed the House, and many people think that with a little more muscle, you could have gotten it through the Senate. \\nLook, I think that our democratic process is painfully slow — even when you\\'ve got Democratic majorities. And this is an issue that, although overwhelmingly Democrats are on the right side of, it\\'s not easy for every Democrat, and it\\'s not uniform. And when you\\'ve got a filibuster in the Senate, you\\'ve got challenges. \\n \\nI think the biggest problem we had was folks like John McCain, who had come out in favor of a cap-and-trade system, getting caught up in a feverish opposition to anything I proposed and reversing themselves — which meant that getting the numbers that we needed was going to be too difficult. And we probably should have moved faster to a nonlegislative strategy, but I don\\'t think that there was some magic recipe whereby we could have gotten cap-and-trade through the Senate without some Republican support. We needed 60 votes. That\\'s the way the filibuster operates there. \\n \\nThis is similar to the discussions I have with progressives sometimes when they say, \"Why didn\\'t you have a trillion-dollar stimulus instead of an $800 billion stimulus?\" And you try to explain, well, this was significantly larger than the New Deal; it was the largest stimulus ever, but I had to get the votes of a couple of Republicans in order to get it done. Or folks who want single-payer health care instead of Obamacare. We had political constraints. \\n \\nNow, what this tells us, generally, is that those who, rightly, see this as the issue of our time have to take politics into account and have to be strategic in terms of how we frame the issues, and we have to make sure that we\\'re bringing the public along with us. There\\'s been good work done in terms of public education over the last several years. I think surveys show that the American people understand this is an urgent problem. But it isn\\'t yet at the point where they consider it the most important problem, and it\\'s not even close. \\n \\nAl Gore once told me that he thinks that everyone who cares deeply about climate change has had what he called an \"oh, shit\" moment when they realized what\\'s at stake. What was your \"oh, shit\" moment? \\nWell, I did grow up in Hawaii. And the way that you grow up in Hawaii is probably surprisingly similar to the way some folks grew up here in the Arctic Circle. There are traditions that are very close to the land — in Hawaii, the water — and you have an intimate awareness of how fragile ecosystems can be. There are coral reefs in Hawaii that, when I was growing up, were lush and full of fish, that now, if you go back, are not. \\n \\nAnd so I don\\'t think that there was a eureka moment. In my early speeches in 2007-2008, we were already talking about this and making it a prominent issue. What\\'s happened during my presidency is each time I get a scientific report, I\\'m made aware that we have less time than we thought, that this is happening faster than we thought. And what that does for me is to say that we have to ring the alarm louder, faster. But, as I said, the good news is that the kind of complete skepticism you had around the science that you saw even two or three years ago, I think, has been so overwhelmed — that we kind of cleared out that underbrush. \\n \\nThe next argument that was being made — and a lot of Republicans have continued to make — is the notion that, well, even if it is a problem, there\\'s no point in us doing something because China won\\'t do something about it. And my trip to China and the joint announcement, I think, was critical in puncturing that notion. \\n \\nEvery so often, John Holdren, the head of my science advisory group, sends out the latest data, and I make sure that not only me but my entire senior staff read it. And the last few reports have gotten everybody feeling like we\\'ve got to get moving on this, and to see what kinds of tools we can use to really have an impact.\\xa0 \\n Obama with Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2009. Feng Li/Getty  \\nSo that brings us back to politics. Obviously one of the biggest sort of impediments to moving faster is the oil cartels — especially the Koch brothers. They\\'re oil billionaires who are doing everything they can to slow the transition to clean energy. You recently singled out Charles Koch for fighting subsidies for clean energy, saying, \"That\\'s not the American way.\" What did you mean by that? \\nWell, it wasn\\'t just that they were trying to eliminate solar subsidies — that\\'s the spin they put on it after I made those remarks down in Nevada — they are actually trying to influence state utilities to make it more expensive for homeowners to install solar panels. And my point was, that\\'s not how the market works. And by the way, they\\'re also happy to take continued massive subsidies that Congress has refused to eliminate, despite me calling for the elimination of those subsidies every single year. \\n \\nEverybody is very selective when they start talking about free-market principles and innovation and entrepreneurship. And it seems as if — and I don\\'t necessarily need to single out the Koch brothers, I think that this is true for a lot of folks in the traditional energy industries — they\\'re fine with sweetheart deals and cushy subsidies for their mature, well-established industries, but somehow when it comes to developing clean energy, they\\'re not simply opposing subsidies, they\\'re actually actively trying to keep competitors out. \\n \\nAnd what\\'s been fascinating is the coalition that you\\'re now seeing between the green movement and some members of the Tea Party in some states, saying, leave us alone. If we want to set up a solar panel or change how energy is distributed, and to reorganize the traditional power grid in a way that is more efficient, saves people money and is more environmentally sound, that\\'s something that government should support. That\\'s not something that government should be trying to impede. \\n \\nLet\\'s talk about the Arctic. The Russian deputy prime minister recently called the Arctic \"Russia\\'s Mecca.\" And there\\'s a lot of talk about Russian operations here, military buildup and a new Cold War brewing. How do you read Russia\\'s intentions up here? \\nSo far, Russia has been a constructive partner in the Arctic Council and has participated with the other Arctic nations in ways that are consistent with the rule of law and a sensible approach to the changes that are taking place in the Arctic. Given that much more of their country and their economy is up north, it\\'s not surprising that they see more opportunities and are more focused on a day-to-day basis on what\\'s taking place here than Washington has been. \\n Sidebar    President Obama Finally Gets Serious About Climate Change »  \\nBut part of the reason that I wanted to come here is that needs to change. The icebreaker announcement was just a concrete example of the need for policymakers, starting from the president on down, to be mindful that this area is changing and is changing faster than policymakers thought it was going to 10 years ago, or five years ago, or last year. \\n \\nSo we\\'re going to have to have more resources up here. I think that we have to work with other countries, including Russia, to establish some clear rules of the road so we don\\'t start seeing some of the same kinds of problems that we\\'ve been seeing in the South China Sea around maritime rules and borders and boundaries. I think that\\'s achievable. Obviously we\\'ve got big differences with the Russians on other issues. But as we\\'ve seen in the discussions with Iran, there is the ability to compartmentalize some of these issues so that even as we have very fierce disagreements with Russia on Ukraine, there remain areas where we should be able to work constructively together. \\n \\nOne thing that I am concerned about is, as a major oil producer, Russia may not be as concerned about climate change as they need to be. And if we\\'ve got problems with public opinion in the United States, I think it\\'s fair to say that those problems are bigger in a country like Russia. And so constantly engaging with them around the science and making it clear that there is an upside for them in navigation and commerce, but there are massive downsides for them as well — as we\\'ve witnessed in the biggest fires that they\\'ve seen in years recently — that is a conversation that we\\'ve got to have on an ongoing basis.\\xa0 \\n The Russian icebreaker Yamal. Nery Ynclan/NBC/Getty  \\nYou\\'ve talked increasingly about climate change as a national-security issue. How would you compare the challenges and the risk to America\\'s security regarding climate change to, say, ISIS or, for that matter, Iran? \\nWell, they\\'re different. And as president and commander in chief, I don\\'t have the luxury of selecting one issue versus the other. They\\'re all major problems. What we know about climate change, though, is that with increasing drought, increasing floods, increasing erosion of coastlines, that\\'s going to impact agriculture; it\\'s going to increase scarcity in parts of the world; it is going to result in displacement of large numbers of people. \\n \\nThe people who live on the island [Kivalina] that we flew over today can move. It\\'s painful for those residents, but it can be done. If the monsoon patterns in South Asia change, you can\\'t move tens of millions of people without the possibilities of refugees, conflict. And the messier the world gets, the more national-security problems we have. In fact, there have been arguments that, for example, what\\'s happening in Syria partly resulted from record drought that led huge numbers of folks off farms and the fields into the cities in Syria, and created a political climate that led to protests that Assad then responded to in the most vicious ways possible. \\n \\nBut that\\'s the kind of national-security challenge that we\\'re looking at with climate change. It will manifest itself in different ways, but what we know from human history is that when large populations are put under severe strain, then they react badly. And that can be expressed in terms of nationalism; it can be expressed in terms of war; it can be expressed in terms of xenophobia and nativism; it can be expressed in terms of terrorism. But the whole package is one that we should be wanting to avoid, if at all possible. \\n \\nThe Paris climate talks that are coming up in December are a big focus of your attention right now, and may be the last best chance for the world to come together and actually do something to slow climate change. How will you define success in Paris? \\nFor us to be able to get the basic architecture in place with aggressive-enough targets from the major emitters that the smaller countries say, \"This is serious\" — that will be a success. \\n \\nI\\'m less concerned about the precise number, because let\\'s stipulate right now, whatever various country targets are, it\\'s still going to fall short of what the science requires. So a percent here or a percent there coming from various countries is not going to be a deal-breaker. But making sure everybody is making serious efforts and that we are making a joint international commitment that is well-defined and can be measured will create the basis for us each year, then, to evaluate, \"How are we doing?\" and will allow us, five years from now, to say the science is new, we need to ratchet it up, and by the way, because of the research and development that we\\'ve put in, we can achieve more ambitious goals. \\n \\nYou think about when I started, we thought we were setting a really bold goal with our plans for solar-power production. And if you had told me in 2007-2008 that the costs for solar would have dropped as much as they have, even Steve Chu, my then-energy secretary, would have told you that\\'s a little crazy. But it has. And I think just last year, costs were down 10 to 20 percent, depending on the region. So human ingenuity, when focused and targeted, can achieve amazing things. \\n \\nAnd the key for Paris is just to make sure that everybody is locked in, saying, \"We\\'re going to do this.\" Once we get to that point, then we can turn the dials. But there will be a momentum that is built, and I\\'m confident that we will then be in a position to listen more carefully to the science — partly because people, I think, will be not as fearful of the consequences or as cynical about what can be achieved. Hope builds on itself. Success breeds success. \\n \\nWhen you talk about capitalism, that reminds me of the pope, who is speaking out about climate change and is trying to build momentum for the Paris talks. \\nI really like the pope. \\n \\nPersonally? \\nYes, he\\'s a good man. And he\\'s on the right side of a lot of stuff. \\n \\nIn the encyclical, the pope talks about what he calls the \"myth of progress.\" And he basically argues that greed and materialism are destroying the planet. How do you interpret that idea? Do you think that dealing with climate change is ultimately going to require rethinking the basic tenets of capitalism? \\nIf you look at human history, it is indisputable that market-based systems have produced more wealth than any other system in human history by a factor of — you choose the number. And that has been, net, a force for good. \\n \\nIn our own lives, you think about the changes in the standard of living that have taken place here in the United States. Then you think about hundreds of millions of people who have been lifted out of poverty in China or in India — and you can\\'t scoff at that. If a child has enough food to eat, if they have medicine that prevents deadly diseases, if people have a roof over their heads and can afford to send their kids to school, that is part of justice and part of my ethics. And so I think a broadside against the entire market-based system would be a mistake. \\n \\nWhat I do think is true is that mindless free-market ideologies that ignore the externalities that any capitalist system produces can cause massive problems. And it\\'s the job of governments and societies to round the edges and to address big system failures. That, by the way, is not controversial among market economists. There are a whole bunch of concepts involved in that that you can open up in any standard economic textbook in the United States or anywhere else in the world. And pollution has always been the classic market failure, where externalities are not captured and the system doesn\\'t deal with them, even though it\\'s having an impact on everybody. \\n \\nSo our goal here has to be to say that climate change is a major market failure, just like smog in Los Angeles was back in the Sixties and Seventies, just like the problems with polluted waters were in the Cuyahoga River. And just as we were able to use the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act to clean up those waters and to clean up that air, just as we were able to solve the acid-rain problem and the growing problem with ozone with some smart regulations, we can do that with climate change. \\n \\nThe difference is that those previous pollution problems were more or less localized, and you weren\\'t seeing the possibility of a global feedback loop that tips us over the edge. So there is a race against time here that we haven\\'t seen before, but the nature of the problem is not that different. \\n \\nAnd I think that the way we solve any big market failure is to have a broad-based conversation and to come to a collective agreement that this is something we\\'re going to take into account in our day-to-day doing business. And when we do that, businesses will find ways to profit from it, jobs will be created. We\\'re already seeing that when it comes to the solar industry. We\\'re seeing that when it comes to the wind industry. And we\\'re seeing that consumers are interested in saving money and using less electricity.\\xa0 \\n President Obama speaking to the press following a roundtable with Alaska Native leaders. Chuck Kennedy/White House  \\nSo I am optimistic about us being able to solve this problem. But it is going to require that our politics catches up with the facts. And right now, in this country, our politics is going through a particularly broken period — Congress has trouble passing a transportation bill, much less solving big problems like this. That\\'s part of the reason why we\\'re having to do so much action, administratively. And that\\'s part of the reason why I took this trip. \\n \\nHistorically, politics catch up when the public cares deeply. And when people couldn\\'t breathe in L.A., the state of California starts saying, \"You\\'ve got to get catalytic converters.\" When the river catches fire in Cuyahoga, the people of Ohio and, eventually, the people nationally, say, \"That\\'s getting kind of out of hand.\" \\n Sidebar    What Megablazes Tell Us About Climate Change »  \\nYou\\'re the leader of the world\\'s largest economy, as well as one of the world\\'s biggest polluters. How do you handle this responsibility of avoiding a potential catastrophe of unimaginable dimensions that will affect all of humanity — and within your daughters\\' lifetimes? \\nI think about it a lot. I think about Malia and Sasha a lot. I think about their children a lot. \\n \\nOne of the great things about being president is you travel a lot and you get to see the world\\'s wonders from a vantage point that very few people get a chance to see. When we were out on the water yesterday, going around those fjords, and the sea otter was swimming on its back and feeding off its belly, and a porpoise jumps out of the water, and a whale sprays — I thought to myself, \"I want to make sure my grandchildren see this.\" \\n \\nWe go back to Hawaii every year, and I intend to, hopefully, spend a lot of time there when I\\'m out of office. I want to make sure my kids, when they go snorkeling, are seeing the same things that I saw when I went snorkeling when I was five years old, or eight years old. I spent a big chunk of my life in Indonesia when I was young, and I want them to be able to have some of the same experiences, walking through a forest and suddenly seeing an ancient temple. And I don\\'t want that gone. \\n \\nAnd so it\\'s probably less of a function of being president, more a function of age [ laughs ] when you start thinking about what you\\'re leaving behind. One of the books I read during vacation was The Sixth Extinction , by Elizabeth Kolbert. And it\\'s a wonderful book, and it makes very clear that big, abrupt changes can happen; they\\'re not outside the realm of possibility. They have happened before, they can happen again. \\n \\nSo all of this makes me feel that I have to tackle this every way that I can. But one of the things about being president is you\\'re also mindful that, despite the office, you don\\'t do things alone. So we\\'ve made big strides with the power-plant rule, but that\\'s not enough. We\\'ve doubled fuel-efficiency standards, but that\\'s not enough. We should triple our investment in energy R&D. I can\\'t do that without Congress. \\n \\nSo that\\'s why I continually go back to the notion that the American people have to feel the same urgency that I do. And it\\'s understandable that they don\\'t, because the science right now feels abstract to people. It will feel less abstract with each successive year. I suspect that the record wildfires that we\\'re seeing, the fact that half of the West is in extreme or severe drought right now, is making people understand this better. If you talk to people in Washington state right now, I suspect, after having tragically lost three firefighters, and seeing vast parts of their state aflame, that they understand it better. If you go down to Florida, and neighborhoods that are now flooding every time the tide rises, they\\'re understanding it better. \\n \\nAnd part of what\\'s happening is a recognition that it is going to be cheaper to take action than not. That\\'s one of the hardest things in politics to convince people of: to make investments today that don\\'t pay off until many years from now. \\n \\nBut what\\'s now happening — and that\\'s part of what I\\'ve been trying to highlight — is that the costs are starting to accrue right now. We\\'re spending about a billion dollars a year on firefighting, and the fire season extends now about two and a half months longer than it did just a few decades ago. And that\\'s money that could be spent on schools. That\\'s money that could be spent on fixing roads. That\\'s money that people could spend in their own households. \\n \\nWhen you look at the changes people are having to make in California in their own lives, and farmers now suddenly realize we\\'re going to have to entirely change how we think about irrigation, well, that\\'s an investment that they\\'re going to have to make. \\n \\nSo we\\'re getting to the point now where we can start attaching dollars and cents to climate change in a way that might not have been true a decade ago – or at least the link might have not been as clear. And that\\'s an opportunity. \\n \\nYou wish that the political system could process an issue like this just based on obscure data and science, but, unfortunately, our system doesn\\'t process things that way. People have to see it and feel it and breathe it. And that makes things a little scarier, because it indicates that we\\'re already losing a lot of time. But, potentially, it gives us the chance to build the kind of political consensus, not just in America but internationally, that\\'s going to be necessary to solve this enormous problem. \\n \\nBut I want to end on an optimistic note. The technologies are there. We\\'ll need more to close the gap entirely, but using what we know right now and what we have right now, we can make huge strides just in the next 20 years. And that 20 years, if we\\'re investing enough in R&D, allows us then to make the next leap forward. And there\\'s a way of doing it that will be compatible with growth, jobs, economic development. \\n \\nI think it\\'s important for us not to pretend that there are no difficult trade-offs at all. The transition will require some tough choices to be made. There are going to be localized impacts for folks who have more of a legacy system of dirty energy. We can accommodate helping those communities transition, but it requires us to feel like we\\'re all in this together. \\n \\nIt\\'s not enough for environmentalists who are distantly removed from an aging coal town in West Virginia to just say, \"Stop it.\" And it\\'s not enough to say to a state like Alaska, \"Cut it out because we think your state is beautiful.\" We\\'ve got to be in there talking to folks about how do we solve some of the technical problems involved; how do we make sure that everybody is benefiting from this transition; and if there are costs involved in this transition, how do we all pull together to make sure that it\\'s not just being borne by one group of people. \\n \\nAnd that\\'s true internationally as well. I can\\'t have a conversation with the prime minister of India and ignore the fact that they still have hundreds of millions of people in poverty and not enough electricity. So if I\\'m going to get him to have an aggressive plan to keep emissions down, then I\\'ve got to be willing to pony up strategies for power that aren\\'t polluting. And some of that may require technology transfers or help to modernize their systems to make them more efficient. \\n \\nWhen we were hiking at the glacier in Seward the other day, one of the rangers who works for the park said that more and more people are making pilgrimages to see the glacier before it vanishes. Some people even kiss it goodbye. And she said there\\'s a sadness in a lot of the people who go there because they know the world is changing so quickly as a result of climate change. Do you ever feel sadness about what we, as human beings, for better or for worse, knowingly and unknowingly, are doing to the planet? \\nThere are some amazing, beautiful things in this world that aren\\'t coming back. And that should give us all pause. But I don\\'t wallow in sadness, because we\\'ve got too much work to do. The world is always changing, and there are going to be changes in our lifetime that I wish hadn\\'t happened. There are also changes that have eradicated polio, and changes that have reduced infant mortality. And those we celebrate. \\n \\nSo there are some things that I\\'ve experienced and seen that I suspect my grandchildren won\\'t, and that\\'s a sad thing. But the world is full of wonders, and I figure that we still have time to save most of them. And our kids will probably discover some new ones.\\xa0 \\n President Obama collecting meltwater runoff from the ice of Exit Glacier. Pete Souza/White House  \\nA fter the formal interview ended, the president and I walked along the sea wall across the street from the high school, which was built to hold back the rising waters of Kotzebue Bay (and which was, ironically, constructed in part with federal dollars from Obama\\'s stimulus plan). The bay was gray and flat, and even though it was only early September, you could already feel winter approaching. The two biggest take-aways from my time with the president were these: First, he is laser-focused on the Paris climate talks and is playing a multidimensional chess game with other nations to build alliances and cut deals to reach a meaningful agreement later this year. Second, whatever deals he cuts, it won\\'t be enough. On this trip, I witnessed all the trappings of presidential power — the jets, the helicopters, the Secret Service agents, the obsequiousness of local politicians. But given the scale of this problem, given the fact that what we need to do is nothing less than reinvent the infrastructure of modern life, even a president as committed and shrewd as Obama can only move us a few steps in the right direction. This is a long war, with everything at stake. \"I do what I can do and as much as I can do,\" the president told me as we walked along Kotzebue Bay. \"What I don\\'t want to do is get paralyzed by the magnitude of the thing, and what I don\\'t want is for people to get paralyzed thinking that somehow this is out of our control. And I\\'m a big believer that the human imagination can solve problems. We don\\'t usually solve them as fast as we need to. It\\'s sort of like two cheers for democracy. We try everything else, I think Churchill said, and when we\\'ve exhausted every other alternative, we finally do the right thing. Hopefully, the same will be true here.\" \\n \\nWe walked a few hundred yards, then Obama stopped to chat with 2011 Iditarod champion John Baker. The president scooped up a sled-dog puppy to hold and was given a baseball cap to take home. At about 8:30 p.m., we motorcaded back to the airport and the president bounded up the steps to Air Force One. A small group of Alaskans waved at him from behind a chain-link fence and shouted goodbyes. He had been in the Arctic for about four hours — but that was four hours more than any other president had done. As I took my seat on Air Force One, the president was already in his leather chair at the conference table on the plane, still wearing his Iditarod hat. He said to his staff, \"Let\\'s get to work.\" \\n \\nFrom The Archives Issue 1245: October 8, 2', 'source': 'Rolling Stone', 'title': 'Obama Takes on Climate Change: The Rolling Stone Interview'}, '_index': 'news', '_type': 'sm'}, 'a48012d9-fb31-4261-b6dc-146fa08834a8': {'_id': 'AVZ49tW0O2kzNGWdm8ev', '_score': 0.8115208, '_source': {'media-type': 'News', 'id': 'a48012d9-fb31-4261-b6dc-146fa08834a8', 'published': '2015-09-02T07:00:00Z', 'content': 'September is National Preparedness Month, what better time to take advantage of resources that are available to help prepare for the next disaster.\\xa0 \\n\\nRecently residents and visitors to the area witnessed the devastation of the wildfires burning throughout California, along with earthquakes and flooding.

Building community resilience requires close coordination with government, emergency managers, public and private sectors, as well as individuals to plan for the needs of the whole community. The goal is to engage the public to make preparedness a part of their daily lives and not just for one single month. \\n\\nLaunched in 2004, National Preparedness Month is FEMA’s national annual preparedness outreach program managed and sponsored by FEMA’s Ready Campaign. \\n\\nReady asks individuals to do four key things: \\n\\n• Be informed about the different types of emergencies that could occur and the appropriate responses. \\n\\n• Make a family emergency plan. \\n\\n• Build an emergency supply kit. \\n\\n• Get involved in community efforts. \\n\\nNational Preparedness Month has partnered with America’s PrepareAthon! America’s PrepareAthon! is an opportunity for individuals, organizations, and communities to prepare for specific hazards through drills, group discussions and exercises. \\n\\nThe National Day of Action is scheduled for Sept. 30 and will revolve around taking the actions to prepare for these six specific hazards: \\n\\n• Earthquake \\n\\n• Flood \\n\\n• Hurricane \\n\\n• Tornado \\n\\n• Wildfire \\n\\n• Winter storm \\n  \\nThe goal of this campaign is to increase the number of individuals who: \\n\\n• Understand which disasters could happen in their community \\n\\n• Know what to do to be safe and mitigate damage \\n\\n• Take action to increase their preparedness \\n\\n• Participate in community resilience planning \\n\\nIn 2011, the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors approved a five-year proclamation, proclaiming September National Preparedness Month in the county of San Bernardino, encouraging all citizens and businesses in San Bernardino County to develop their own emergency preparedness plan and work together toward creating a more prepared society. \\n\\nResidents interested in more information can learn more about America’s PrepareAthon! and National Preparedness Month at www.ready.gov or call 800-BE-READY. To obtain more preparedness activity information, contact your city or the San Bernardino County Fire Department/Office of Emergency Services at 909-356-3998 or visit \\n\\nwww.sbcfire.org.', 'source': 'Big Bear Grizzly', 'title': 'September is ...National Preparedness Month'}, '_index': 'news', '_type': 'sm'}}\n"
