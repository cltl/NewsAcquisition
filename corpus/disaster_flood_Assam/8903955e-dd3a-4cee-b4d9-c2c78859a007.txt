Assam flood situation grim, over 9 lakh people hit
  Guwahati, Sep 2 (IANS) The flood situation in Assam continues to be grim as more than 900,000 people in 19 districts remain affected following incessant rainfall in the upper reaches of neighbouring Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh, officials said. 
 
According to the state disaster management authority, four people have died due to floods in Nagaon and Morigaon districts since Tuesday. 
 
The water resources department said rivers flowing through Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Tinsukia, Baksa, Nalbari, Barpeta and Dibrugarh were in spate following incessant rainfall since the last few days, leading to submerging of over 2,000 villages — over 500 in Dhemaji alone. 
 
According to the disaster management authority, the floods have affected 9,98,730 people in 2,005 villages, and submerged over 1.5 lakh hectares of agricultural land. 
 
Over 1,75,000 people were taking shelter in 305 relief camps set up by the district administrations in 11 flood-hit districts. 
 
The floods have also led to massive damage of houses, bridges and roads, cutting off many areas from rest of the state. 
 
The Majuli river island in Jorhat district has been cut off, as the district administration suspended ferry services due to rising water level in the Brahmaputra river. 
 
Similarly, ferry services between Guwahati and north Guwahati and to many riverine areas in Dhubri districts have also been suspended.
