Assam government refutes Sarbananda Sonowal's claim that Centre alloted Rs 207 crore to state
GUWAHATI: Assam government has refuted Union Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal's claim that the Centre had released Rs 207 crore for flood relief to the state this year. 

The state government in a press release clarified today that the Rs 207 crore released by the Centre under State Disaster Response Funds this year "has not only been released to Assam but also to all 26 states". 

"Rs 207 crore received by Assam in May this year is merely the first instalment of the central share of SDRF receivable by the state along with all other states in normal course," the government pointed out. 

"It is merely the first instalment of the current year's central allocation of Rs 414 crore available under the SDRF," it said. 

In fact, the state is yet to receive special Central assistance under National Disaster Response Funds for the devastating floods that occurred in Assam during last year, the release added. 

"In view of the ongoing Assam floods, Sonowal should pressurise the Centre to release the due funds to the state government to meet the emergent situation," the release quoted Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi as saying. 

Criticising the role of Sonowal, who hails from Assam, on various issues concerning the state, Gogoi said that Sonowal had "not pressurised" the Centre for continuation of the Special Category Status to northeastern states during the meeting of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh with chief ministers on July 11 last. 

"He took a mute stand in this regard," the CM said.
